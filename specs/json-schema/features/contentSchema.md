# `contentSchema`

Source: JSON Schema 2020-12, Validation, §8.5 "A Vocabulary for the
Contents of String-Encoded Data → contentSchema".

Supplies a schema describing the structure of a JSON **string**'s
*decoded* contents — an embedded document (typically JSON) carried
inside a string. In 2020-12 it is an **annotation by default**. **Not
supported — rejected at load.** It describes an embedded document whose
typed lowering is genuinely ambiguous (P6), and it is only meaningful
alongside [[contentMediaType]], which is itself rejected.

## Spec summary

Verbatim (2020-12 validation, §8.5):

> If the instance is a string, and if "contentMediaType" is present, this
> property contains a schema which describes the structure of the string.

> The value of this property MUST be a valid JSON Schema.

> [It] SHOULD be ignored if "contentMediaType" is not present.

Distilled:
- Value **MUST be a valid JSON Schema** (a subschema for the *decoded*
  content).
- **Only meaningful with [[contentMediaType]]** — the media type says how
  to parse the string; `contentSchema` describes the parse result.
- **Annotation by default** — it does not assert unless an implementation
  opts in, and even then only after decoding the embedded document.
- Describes a **string that embeds another document**, e.g.
  `contentMediaType:"application/json"` + `contentSchema` for the nested
  JSON.

## Support decision

**Support:** no — **rejected at load time (P6 / P7.1).**

- **The embedded document has no coherent lowering (P6).** A string with
  `contentMediaType:"application/json"` + `contentSchema` is a **document
  inside a document**: on the wire it is a *string* whose text is itself
  a JSON value matching the subschema. Two lowerings are possible and
  neither is right — keep a bare `string` (and silently drop the nested
  structure the author declared), or emit the decoded nested **type**
  (and double-encode on the wire, since the child is serialized to a
  string, then embedded in the parent's JSON). Which one the author meant
  is unrecoverable. This is precisely the ambiguous, non-lowerable
  construct the strict subset rejects, the same posture as [[not]] and
  the boolean-logic applicators.
- **It depends on a rejected keyword.** `contentSchema` is inert without
  [[contentMediaType]] (the spec says to ignore it when the media type is
  absent), and [[contentMediaType]] is itself rejected (no emit site). So
  the pairing that gives `contentSchema` meaning never reaches code
  generation.
- **Accepted-but-unenforced is the P10 footgun.** Retaining it without
  decoding-and-validating the embedded document would present a
  constrained-looking schema that enforces nothing on the nested content
  — the "looks constrained, silently isn't" case **P10** forbids.

Loader behavior:
- Any `contentSchema` present → **reject** with a fix-it: if the field
  really carries an embedded JSON document, model it as a **nested typed
  field** directly (a property of the decoded type) rather than a string
  with `contentSchema`; the subset has no embedded-document string type.
- The value is **not** inspected, and is never lowered. The keyword's own
  rejection is the diagnostic the author sees: grading a subschema that is being
  discarded can only replace that diagnostic with one about a keyword *inside* a
  construct the loader rejects outright, which sends the author to the wrong
  line. A non-schema value (`contentSchema: 42`) therefore rejects on the same
  rule as any other `contentSchema`.
- Present without [[contentMediaType]] → reject as inert (the spec would
  ignore it; a dead keyword signals author confusion, P7.1).

## Type mapping

None — rejected before any type is emitted.

## Validator mapping

None — rejected at load time, so there is no (de)serialize boundary and
no serialize-side behavior (**P12**).

## Property-testing matrix

### Rejected at load time (negative) — the whole surface

| Reason | Example |
|---|---|
| Embedded document (non-lowerable, P6) | `{type:"string", contentMediaType:"application/json", contentSchema:{type:"object", properties:{…}}}` |
| Inert without media type (P7.1) | `{type:"string", contentSchema:{type:"object"}}` |
| Non-schema value | `{…, contentSchema:42}` (rejected on the keyword, not on the value) |

There are no accepted or runtime fixtures: the keyword never reaches code
generation.

## Interactions

- **[[contentMediaType]]**: the keyword `contentSchema` depends on; both
  reject, so an embedded structured document is inexpressible. The
  media-type reject is owned there.
- **[[contentEncoding]]**: the other content keyword — supported for
  `base64` → native bytes. An embedded *structured* document
  (`contentSchema`) is the opposite case: structure to lower, not bytes,
  and it is the one that has no coherent type.
- **[[not]]** / **[[anyOf]]** / **[[if-then-else]]**: siblings in the
  "ambiguous / non-lowerable, reject per P6" family — `contentSchema` is
  the embedded-document member.
- **[[properties]]**: the fix-it target — model the nested document as a
  real typed field instead of a schema-annotated string.

## Ecosystem variance

| Source dialect | Action |
|---|---|
| JSON Schema 2020-12 | Annotation by default → reject (non-lowerable embedded document). |
| OpenAPI 3.1 | Adopts 2020-12; `contentSchema` native → reject. |
| OpenAPI 3.0 / draft-07 | No `contentSchema` keyword — nothing to reject. |
