# `title`

Source: JSON Schema 2020-12, Validation vocabulary, §9.1
"A Vocabulary for Basic Meta-Data Annotations → title and description".

A short human-readable label for the schema it sits on. In the spec it is
a **pure annotation** — it never affects validation, and it never affects
the emitted *type*. We give it exactly one operational role: it becomes
the **summary line of the generated doc comment** on the type or member it
decorates (a Go `//` comment, a TS/Java block comment, a Python
docstring). Crucially, and unlike much of the ecosystem,
`title` is **never** used to derive a type or field *name* — names come
from the `$defs` key and the [[properties]] resolved policy, never from
free-form prose (see Type mapping and Ecosystem variance).

## Spec summary

Verbatim (2020-12 validation, §9.1):

> The value of both of these keywords MUST be a string.

> Both of these keywords can be used to decorate a user interface with
> information about the data produced by this user interface. A title
> will preferably be short, whereas a "description" will provide
> explanation for the purpose of the instance described by this schema.

Distilled:
- An **annotation**, not an assertion: per spec it **never changes
  whether an instance validates**. A wire value is judged by the schema's
  assertions alone, `title` present or not.
- Its value **MUST be a string** (the spec's own MUST, not a
  strengthening of ours).
- A **short label** — the spec's own guidance ("preferably be short").
  Its sibling [[description]] carries the prose.
- Applies to **any subschema**: a `$defs` type, a property subschema, an
  array `items` subschema — anywhere a schema node appears.

## Support decision

**Support:** yes — as a **doc-comment summary only**. It emits no
validator, no adapter behavior, and no type/field name.

The defining choices (citing [[PRINCIPLES.md]]):
- **Annotation, no runtime effect (P10/P12).** `title` contributes **no**
  constraint predicate to the shared `Validate` and **no** parse/encode
  adapter logic. It is inert at runtime in both directions — even more
  inert than [[default]], which at least owns omit-unset + materialize-on-
  read. `title` touches only the *generated source text*.
- **Never a type name (P13, P15, P1).** The obvious ecosystem move —
  using `title` to name the generated model (openapi-generator does this
  for inline schemas; datamodel-code-generator under `--use-title-as-name`
  — see Ecosystem variance) — is **deliberately refused**:
  - **P13 (stability).** Type names must be stable across schema
    revisions. `title` is free-form UI prose; letting it name a type means
    a cosmetic copy-edit ("User" → "User account") silently **renames the
    type** and breaks every call site — a breaking change from a change
    that was never meant to be one. Our type names derive from the `$defs`
    key / property name, which authors already treat as an identifier.
  - **P15 (one namespace, no mangling).** A prose title routed into the
    identifier namespace multiplies the collision surface (two types titled
    "Request", a title colliding with a `$defs` key) with no stable
    escape hatch — `title` cannot double as both a display label and a
    de-collided identifier.
  - **P1 (polyglot consistency).** A title-derived name skips the
    [[properties]] Stage 1–4 case-mapping pipeline, so it would land
    differently per language — the exact footgun openapi-generator was
    filed for (issue #5248: title-named schemas bypass the naming
    transform and cause import failures). Our names go through one
    pipeline precisely so all four targets agree.
- **Summary line, co-owned with [[description]].** `title` and
  [[description]] feed the **same** generated doc comment: `title` is the
  **first/summary line**, [[description]] the body. The shared doc-comment
  machinery (placement, wrapping, escaping per language) is specified in
  [[description]]; this spec owns only `title`'s contribution (the summary
  line) and its load-time shape checks.

Loader behavior:
- `title` value **not a string** → **reject** (P7.1; and the spec's own
  MUST). `{title: 42}`, `{title: ["a"]}`.
- `title` an **empty or whitespace-only** string → **reject** as
  degenerate: it renders an empty summary line, which is dead metadata and
  signals author confusion (P7.1). Drop it, or give it text.
- `title` containing a **newline** → **reject**: `title` is a short label
  (spec: "preferably be short"), and a multi-line summary line is a
  category error — prose belongs in [[description]]. Diagnostic: move the
  body to `description`.
- `title` as a **sibling of `$ref`** is **not** rejected: a
  sibling-bearing `$ref` is rewritten to an implicit `allOf` and **merged**
  (see [[ref]]), so a use-site `title` folds into the merged schema under
  the [[allOf]] rule below — deduped against the target's own `title` when
  identical, and when they differ the use-site `title` **wins** (it is last
  in the rewrite; see [[ref]]).
- Multiple `title`s applicable to one node after an [[allOf]] merge (P6),
  whether from an explicit `allOf` or a `$ref` sibling → **last-wins**:
  identical values dedup, and when they differ the **last-merged** `title`
  survives (see [[allOf]]). A differing title is a deterministic override,
  never a reject. Mirrors [[default]] and [[description]].

## Type mapping

**None.** `title` does not change the emitted type, and — the load-bearing
negative — it does **not** contribute the type's or field's *name*
(rationale in Support decision). The type comes from [[type]] +
[[nullability]]; the name comes from the `$defs` key / [[properties]]
resolved policy / [[ref]]. `title`'s sole materialization is the
**summary line of the doc comment**, which carries no type information:

| Placement | Where the summary line lands |
|---|---|
| `$defs` type | doc comment on the generated **type** (Go `type` / TS `interface` / Python class / Java class) |
| property subschema | doc comment on the generated **field/member** |
| `items` / other inline subschema | doc comment on the declaration synthesized from that subschema, if any; otherwise dropped (nowhere to attach) |

Per-language rendering of the summary line (the shared doc-comment
mechanism — placement, line-wrapping, escaping — is owned by
[[description]]; this is only `title`'s slot in it):

| Language | Summary-line mechanism |
|---|---|
| Go | leading `// ` line of the doc comment above the `type`/field, **led by the identifier name** per Go convention — `// <Name> <title>` (see below). |
| TypeScript | first line of the `/** … */` JSDoc above the `interface`/field. |
| Python | first line of the class **docstring**; for a **field**, the first line of the string literal that follows the field declaration (the attribute-docstring convention documentation tooling reads). |
| Java | first sentence of the `/** … */` Javadoc above the class/getter. |

**Go — the identifier-led first line.** Idiomatic Go doc comments for an
exported identifier **begin with the name being described** (`godoc` /
`golint`: `// User is a registered account.`, not `// A registered
account.`). So Go does **not** emit the bare `title` as the summary line
the way the other three languages do — it prefixes the identifier:

```go
// User A registered user account.
type User struct { … }

// RoomID Identifier of the chat room.
RoomID string
```

- The line is `// <Name> <title>`, where `<Name>` is the generated type or
  field identifier. This keeps the comment name-led (satisfying `golint`'s
  "comment should be of the form `<Name> …`" and staying greppable by
  identifier) while still surfacing the author's `title`.
- **Redundancy guard:** if the `title` already begins with `<Name>`
  (case-insensitively) — e.g. field `Email` with `title:"Email address"` —
  the identifier is **not** doubled; the `title` is emitted as-is
  (`// Email address`), since it is already name-led. This avoids the
  `// Email Email address` stutter.
- Because a `title` is a short **label** (a noun phrase), not necessarily
  a grammatical predicate, the name-led join reads as a caption rather
  than a full sentence — acceptable and still idiomatic (the convention
  golint enforces is the *name-first* rule, not sentence grammar). Authors
  wanting a full-sentence doc put the prose in [[description]], which
  becomes the body under the same name-led first line.

The name-led first-line rule is a property of the **Go doc comment as a
whole** (it governs whichever text — `title` or, absent a title,
[[description]] — opens the comment), so the mechanism is co-owned with
[[description]]; this spec fixes only how `title` fills that opening slot.

When both `title` and [[description]] are present, the doc comment is the
summary line (`title`) then the body ([[description]]); when only `title`
is present, the doc comment is just the summary line. On an ordinary
declaration `title` synthesizes no identifier. Beside a `$ref`, the implicit
merge may create a standalone use-site type whose position-derived name
participates in P15; the title text itself never supplies that name.

## Validator mapping

`title` emits **no validator** and **no adapter behavior**. It is an
annotation (§9.1): it never appears in the shared `Validate`, never runs in
the parse or encode adapter, and never causes a runtime pass/fail in either
direction. Its entire effect is at generation time, in the emitted doc
comment. There is nothing to check at runtime and nothing to test at the
(de)serializer boundary.

## Property-testing matrix

### Accepted (positive)

| Shape | Example |
|---|---|
| Title on a `$defs` type | `{title:"User account", type:"object", …}` → type doc summary |
| Title on a property | `properties:{email:{title:"Email address", type:"string"}}` → field doc summary |
| Title + description | `{title:"User", description:"A registered user.", type:"object"}` → summary + body |
| Title on a scalar member | `{title:"Age in years", type:"integer"}` |
| Title sibling of a `$ref` (merged, last-wins) | `{$ref:"#/$defs/User", title:"Account"}` → the use-site `title` overrides the target's when they differ (see [[ref]]) |
| Differing merged titles (last-wins) | `allOf:[{title:"A"},{title:"B"}]` → `"B"` (see [[allOf]]) |

### Rejected at load time (negative)

| Reason | Example |
|---|---|
| Non-string value | `{title:42}`, `{title:["a"]}` |
| Empty / whitespace-only | `{title:""}`, `{title:"  "}` |
| Multi-line (prose in a label) | `{title:"User\naccount"}` (use `description`) |

### Runtime fixtures

None. `title` has no runtime behavior — it neither validates nor
(de)serializes. Its only observable output is the generated doc comment,
covered by generation-snapshot tests, not runtime fixtures.

## Interactions

- **[[description]]**: the sibling annotation and co-owner of the doc
  comment. `title` is the summary line; `description` is the body. The
  shared doc-comment machinery (placement, wrapping, escaping) is
  specified in [[description]]; `title` only fills its summary slot.
- **[[properties]]**: owns the field/type **naming** policy that `title`
  deliberately does **not** participate in. A property's `title`
  decorates the generated member's doc comment; it never renames the
  member (the name stays the property key, per the resolved policy).
- **[[ref]]**: a `title` **sibling** of a `$ref` is not rejected — the
  `$ref` and its siblings are rewritten to an implicit [[allOf]] and merged
  (see [[ref]]); because the rewrite puts the siblings last, a use-site
  `title` **overrides** the referenced target's under the last-wins rule
  below.
- **[[allOf]]**: merges (P6) — explicit or via a `$ref` sibling — can bring
  multiple `title`s onto one node; identical values dedup, differing ones
  resolve **last-wins** (see [[allOf]]), never a reject.
- **[[services]]**: the Nexus envelope decorates services/operations with
  `description` (see the envelope's recognized members); `title` is a
  **schema** annotation and applies to the types under `$defs` and their
  members, not to the envelope root.
- **[[type]]**, **[[nullability]]**, **[[required]]**: fully orthogonal —
  `title` changes neither the type, its nullability, nor its presence.

## Ecosystem variance

| Source dialect | Action |
|---|---|
| JSON Schema 2020-12 | Native annotation (§9.1). Rendered as the doc-comment summary line. |
| OpenAPI 3.1 | Adopts 2020-12 — `title` native, same annotation semantics. |
| OpenAPI 3.0 | `title` present; same annotation semantics. |
| Swagger 2.0 / draft-4 | `title` present; same annotation semantics. |

`title` is universal across dialects and needs no rewrite. The **one
substantive divergence is what we deliberately do *not* do**: much of the
codegen ecosystem treats `title` as a **type/model-naming input**, which
we refuse.

- **openapi-generator** uses the `title` attribute when flattening inline
  / composed schemas to *name* the generated model (falling back to
  `InlineObject` when absent). This is a documented footgun: the
  title-derived name **skips the normal name-transformation function**, so
  it diverges from the generator's own naming conventions and can cause
  import failures — the subject of issue #5248, "Do not use the title
  attribute to control code generation."
- **datamodel-code-generator** exposes `--use-title-as-name`,
  an **opt-in** flag to use `title` as the class name — off by default,
  precisely because it is surprising.

We take neither behavior. Our type/field names come from the `$defs` key
and the [[properties]] resolved policy — stable across revisions (P13),
run through one case-mapping pipeline for cross-language agreement (P1),
and de-collided in one namespace pass (P15). `title` stays what the spec
says it is: a display label, surfaced only in the doc comment. This is
stricter than the ecosystem in the sense that a `title` will *never*
influence an identifier here — a schema that relied on
openapi-generator's title-naming gets a name derived from its `$defs` key
instead (and keeps the `title` as its doc summary).

## See also

- [[description]] — the sibling annotation; co-owns the doc comment
  (`title` = summary line, `description` = body) and specifies the shared
  doc-comment machinery.
- [[properties]] — owns the field/type naming policy `title` deliberately
  does not touch.
- [[ref]] — a `title` sibling of a `$ref` merges via the implicit-`allOf`
  rewrite; use-site value wins (last-wins).
- [[default]] — the other basic-metadata annotation (§9.2); unlike
  `title` it carries operational semantics (omit-unset, materialize-on-
  read), whereas `title` is purely a doc comment.
- [[services]] — the Nexus envelope uses `description` on
  services/operations; `title` decorates the `$defs` types and members.
