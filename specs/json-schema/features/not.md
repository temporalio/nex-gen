# `not`

Source: JSON Schema 2020-12, Core (Applicator vocabulary), §10.2.1.4
"Keywords for Applying Subschemas With Boolean Logic → not".

The **negation** boolean-logic applicator: an instance is valid iff it
**fails** to validate against the subschema. **Not supported** — rejected at
load time per **P6** (categorical exclusion, not a deferral). Where [[allOf]]
(intersection) and [[oneOf]] (a closed sum type) construct a type out of
positive assertions, `not` does the opposite: it names a **complement** — the
open set of everything a subschema *rejects* — which has no members, no kind,
and no shape to lower to.

## Spec summary

Verbatim (2020-12 core, Applicator, §10.2.1.4):

> This keyword's value MUST be a valid JSON Schema.

> An instance is valid against this keyword if it fails to validate
> successfully against the schema defined by this keyword's value.

Distilled:
- The value is a single subschema. The instance is valid iff it does **not**
  validate against that subschema — validity is inverted.
- This is set **complement**, not a choice ([[oneOf]]/[[anyOf]]) or a
  combination ([[allOf]]). `not: S` denotes *the universe minus everything S
  accepts* — an open, unbounded set defined entirely by exclusion.
- The keyword asserts what an instance **is not**. It contributes no type, no
  member, no positive constraint of its own; its only content is the
  subschema being negated.

## Support decision

**Support:** no — **rejected at load time (P6).**

Negation has no coherent typed lowering in the strict subset:

- **P6 (strict subset), a complement is not a type.** The subset builds each
  type out of **positive assertions** — a [[type]] token, [[properties]],
  bounds, a [[const]]/[[enum]] value set. `not` supplies none of these; it
  describes the *anti-set* of a subschema. Even the simplest case,
  `not: {type: string}` ("anything except a string"), has no static type
  across the four targets: it spans every other JSON kind at once, so the
  only lowerings are to forfeit typing (`any`/`interface{}`/`Object`) or to
  invent a positive enumeration of "all kinds but one" that no source
  actually stated (**P1** — it would not round-trip identically). Negating a
  *constraint* (`not: {maximum: 10}`, `not: {const: "x"}`) is no better: the
  result is still an open complement — "any number strictly greater than 10,
  or not a number at all", "any value that is not the string `x`" — with no
  bounded, materializable shape.
- **P7 / P7.1 (reject ambiguity loudly).** A schema whose admissible values
  are defined by what they *exclude* cannot be turned into a concrete type
  without guessing which positive shape the author meant. Emitting `any` (or
  silently dropping the negation) is exactly the silently-wrong output the
  mission forbids; we error at generator time instead.
- **No positive content to attach a validator to.** Unlike a bound or a
  pattern, `not` has no value to check *for* — only a subschema to check
  *against* and then invert. There is no field, type, or predicate it maps
  to; its whole job is to reject, which is the anti-constructive move the
  subset excludes.

Two degenerate forms are incoherent rather than merely un-lowerable, and are
rejected as such:

- **`not: {}` / `not: true`** — negating the always-valid schema means
  **nothing** validates: the enclosing schema rejects every instance. An
  unsatisfiable type is a dead type — reject (**P7.1**).
- **`not: false`** — negating the always-invalid schema means **everything**
  validates: the keyword is a no-op that constrains nothing. A dead keyword —
  reject with a diagnostic that it has no effect.

Loader behavior:
- Any `not` present → reject with a located diagnostic (recurse into the
  negated subschema for validity, but never lower it). This holds on a raw
  [[allOf]] branch, and on the implicit conjunct of a `$ref`-with-siblings: the
  location carries the branch index and the diagnostic is this one, never a
  merge conflict over the keyword's value.
- `not: {}` / `not: true` → reject as **unsatisfiable** (accepts no instance).
- `not: false` → reject as a **no-op** (accepts every instance).
- The diagnostic offers the coherent alternatives:
  1. **Positive [[type]] / constraints** — state what values *are* allowed
     rather than what they are not (`not: {type: string}`, where the intent
     was "a number", → `type: number`).
  2. **[[enum]] / [[const]]** — for a *closed* value set, enumerate the
     admissible values instead of excluding others; note that excluding a
     value from an **open** domain ("any string except `x`") is *not* a
     closed set and remains inexpressible.
  3. **The complementary bound** — when negating a bound is really the
     opposite bound, use it directly (`not: {maximum: 10}` meaning "> 10" →
     [[exclusiveMinimum]] `10`; `not: {minimum: 0}` meaning "< 0" →
     [[exclusiveMaximum]] `0`).

## Type mapping

None — rejected before any type is emitted.

## Validator mapping

None — rejected at load time, so there is no (de)serialize boundary and no
serialize-side behavior (**P12**).

## Property-testing matrix

### Rejected at load time (negative) — the whole surface

| Reason | Example |
|---|---|
| Negated kind — open complement (P6) | `{not:{type:string}}` (state the positive [[type]]) |
| Negated bound (P6) | `{not:{maximum:10}}` (use [[exclusiveMinimum]] `10` if "> 10") |
| Negated value — open exclusion (P6/P7.1) | `{not:{const:"x"}}`, `{not:{enum:["a","b"]}}` (enumerate the *admissible* set with [[enum]]) |
| Negated object shape (P6) | `{not:{required:["a"]}}` ("must not have `a`" — no positive shape) |
| Unsatisfiable — negates always-valid | `{not:{}}`, `{not:true}` (accepts no instance) |
| No-op — negates always-invalid | `{not:false}` (accepts every instance) |
| Double negation | `{not:{not:{type:string}}}` (still a combinator; reject — write `type:string`) |

There are no accepted or runtime fixtures: the keyword never reaches code
generation.

## Interactions

- **[[allOf]]**: the admitted intersection applicator — it *combines*
  positive schemas and flattens to one materialized type at load. `not` is
  its opposite: it removes from the universe rather than combining, so it does
  not flatten and has nothing to merge. An [[allOf]] branch that is itself a
  `not` is rejected for this reason ([[allOf]]).
- **[[oneOf]]**: the admitted closed sum type with a decidable selector. It
  earns its place by being *constructive and disjoint*; `not` is neither — it
  names a complement, not one of a closed set of positive branches.
- **[[anyOf]]** / **[[if-then-else]]**: the other boolean-logic / conditional
  applicators rejected per **P6**. `not` is the **negation** member of that
  rejected family — [[anyOf]] the *inclusive-or*, [[if-then-else]] the
  *conditional* — all three lacking the positive, decidable shape that admits
  [[allOf]] and [[oneOf]].
- **[[enum]] / [[const]]**: the coherent way to express a *closed* set of
  admissible values; the fix when `not: {const}` / `not: {enum}` was reaching
  for exclusion but the real intent was a bounded, positive value set.
- **[[exclusiveMinimum]] / [[exclusiveMaximum]]**: the complementary bounds a
  negated [[maximum]]/[[minimum]] should be rewritten to when the negation was
  really "the other side of the bound".

## Ecosystem variance

| Source dialect | Action |
|---|---|
| JSON Schema 2020-12 | Reject (P6). |
| OpenAPI 3.1 | `not` present (3.1 adopts 2020-12) → reject; the fix-it points at a positive [[type]]/constraint or an [[enum]]. |
| OpenAPI 3.0 | `not` exists with the same negation semantics → reject. |
| Swagger 2.0 | No `not` keyword — nothing to reject. |
| draft-4..7 | `not` present since draft-4 with identical semantics → reject. |
