# `$ref`

Source: JSON Schema 2020-12, Core vocabulary, §8.2.3.1 (`$ref`) and
§8.2.4 (`$defs`).

The reference keyword. `$ref` lets one schema reuse another by URI
reference; `$defs` is the standard container for named reusable
subschemas. Together they are the structural backbone of any non-trivial
schema set, and they are what let the generator emit **named, reused
types** instead of duplicating shapes. This spec also owns the
cross-file story: how a set of input files becomes one generated package
per language (the layout itself lives in [[generated-file-layout]]).

## Spec summary

- `$ref` is a URI-reference resolved against the current base URI. Its
  fragment is a JSON Pointer (`#/$defs/Foo`) or a plain-name `$anchor`.
- In 2020-12, `$ref` **may carry sibling keywords** (unlike draft-07,
  where siblings were ignored); siblings combine with the referenced
  schema as an implicit `allOf`.
- `$defs` is an object of named subschemas. It has no validation effect
  on its own — entries are reached only via `$ref`.
- `$id` declares a base URI for a schema resource and re-bases the
  resolution of relative `$ref`s beneath it; it may also appear nested to
  embed a separate schema resource.

## Support decision

**Support: partial** — `$ref` to **named targets only**, **local files
only**, **no `$id`**; sibling keywords are accepted and merged as an
implicit `allOf` ([[allOf]]).

`$defs` is **supported** as the canonical (and only) place a `$ref` may
target by name.

Rationale (citing [[PRINCIPLES.md]]):
- **External refs are local-file-only**: file refs resolve to
  YAML/JSON on disk relative to the referring file; HTTP/URI refs are
  rejected for reproducibility.
- **P14 (one file per input; merge recursion, not files)**: each input
  file becomes one generated module in a single flat package; reference
  cycles hoist the cyclic types into a shared module rather than merging
  whole files (see Recursion below and [[generated-file-layout]]).
- **P7 / P7.1 (strict schema, reject loudly)**: every accepted `$ref`
  must resolve to a **nameable, top-level generated type** — codegen has
  no name for a pointer into the middle of a schema.
- **`$ref` siblings are an implicit `allOf`**, and `allOf` is a supported
  load-time merge ([[allOf]]): a sibling-bearing `$ref` is rewritten to
  `allOf:[{$ref:X},{…siblings}]` and **merged** into a single schema. `$id`
  re-basing opens a URI-resolution surface we otherwise avoid (**P6**).
- **`x-<lang>-name` is the one exception**, because it is not a conjunct: it
  names the **member** the reference is bound to ([[properties]] Stage 4) and
  asserts nothing about the value, so merging it would *clone* the referenced
  target into the use site instead of referencing it. A `$ref` carrying
  nothing but name overrides therefore stays a plain reference with the member
  renamed — and without that, a member whose type is a `$ref` could not be
  renamed at all, leaving a member named `class` unfixable in Python and Java.

### Accepted ref forms

After JSON Pointer unescaping per RFC 6901 (`~1` → `/`, `~0` → `~`):

| Form | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `#` | the referring file's **root** schema |
| `#/$defs/<Name>` | a named definition (nested `$defs` chains that terminate at a named def are allowed) |
| `<relative-path>` | another file's **root** schema |
| `<relative-path>#/$defs/<Name>` | a named def in another file |

### Loader behavior (rejected at load time)

Each rejection carries a diagnostic naming the schema location and a
fix-it:

- **Pointer into a non-`$defs` node** (`#/properties/x/items`, `#/items`,
  …) → reject. Fix-it: "extract the target into `$defs` and reference
  that." (Every ref must resolve to a nameable type — P7.)
- **Sibling keys alongside `$ref`** — accepted: the implicit-`allOf`
  sugar is rewritten to an explicit `allOf` and merged ([[allOf]]). The
  merged result is subject to `allOf`'s reject rules (e.g. a sibling that
  contradicts the target), and unresolvable/cyclic targets still reject
  here. Two sibling classes are **not** merged and leave the reference intact:
  an `x-<lang>-name`, which renames the member (above); and the **non-conjunct
  annotations** `$comment`, `examples` and [[deprecated]] — the last at **either
  value**, since it marks the member rather than asserting anything about the
  referenced value — which are dropped **before** the loader decides whether the
  reference needs an implicit merge, so they can neither clone the target into a
  new type nor add a **P15** identifier. See [[allOf]] for the same rule stated
  from the merge side, and [[deprecated]] for the member-marking rule.
  *(Status: unimplemented — the loader currently admits only the four
  `x-<lang>-name` keywords here, so a non-conjunct annotation still triggers the
  fold. The clause is the contract; the gate is the defect.)*
- **`$id` anywhere** → reject. Fix-it: "remove `$id`; refs resolve by file path
  + JSON pointer." (local-file-only — no URI resolution.) The reject is
  **position-independent**: a root `$id`, a nested one, one on any [[allOf]]
  branch including a non-first conjunct, and one on the implicit conjunct a
  `$ref`-with-siblings forms all reject alike. A merge must not drop it as
  unrecognized on the branch it did not happen to read first.
- **HTTP/URI ref**, `$anchor` fragment, `$dynamicRef`, `$dynamicAnchor`
  → reject (local-file-only / P6). These anchor and dynamic-reference
  keywords are owned by this spec — see Anchors & dynamic references below.
- **Unresolvable target** (missing file, missing `$defs` entry) → reject.
  (`..` segments are resolved, not rejected — see Resolution.)
- **`$defs` outside a model position** → reject. A `$defs` bucket belongs on a
  document root, a `$defs` entry, or a nested `$defs` chain — the positions
  whose entries become named models. Under an ordinary subschema (a property, an
  `items`, a [[oneOf]] branch, an `additionalProperties` schema, a [[contains]]
  matcher) it declares nothing any `$ref` can reach, so accepting it silently
  discards whatever it holds — including keywords the subset rejects outright
  and an invalid `type`, all of which reject one level up. Nor is such a bucket
  inert: a cross-file `$ref` inside it still joins the input closure and renames
  every emitted module. Fix-it: "move the definition to the document's
  `$defs`."
  *(Status: unimplemented — the raw grammar pass walks such a bucket, so a
  misspelled keyword inside it still rejects, but no semantic validator reaches
  it and the bucket itself is accepted.)*
- **Absolute-path `$ref`**, and a `$ref` that raises the input root above the
  **invocation root** → reject (see Resolution, where both carry a
  `Status: unimplemented` note).

### Anchors & dynamic references — rejected

The 2020-12 anchoring keywords all name a target by some route **other**
than the `$defs` key + JSON Pointer this spec is built on, and each opens
a resolution surface the strict subset avoids (**P6**). They live here,
alongside `$id`, because they are reference-mechanism variants — not
standalone applicators — and share one rationale:

- **`$anchor`** declares a plain-name fragment (`{"$anchor":"foo"}`,
  referenced as `#foo`). It is a *second* way to name a subschema that is
  not the `$defs` key our type-name derivation reads (see Type-name
  derivation), and in practice travels with `$id` re-basing. Accepting it
  would fork naming into two mechanisms with no added expressiveness →
  **reject**. Fix-it: "put the target in `$defs` and reference it by
  `#/$defs/<Name>`."
- **`$dynamicRef` / `$dynamicAnchor`** resolve *at validation time*
  against the dynamic scope — the same `$dynamicRef` binds to whichever
  `$dynamicAnchor` is outermost on the current evaluation path, so it
  denotes **different schemas for different instances**. There is no single
  static target to lower to a named type at codegen time (**P6/P7** — no
  decidable typed lowering) → **reject**. Fix-it: "use a static
  `#/$defs/<Name>` reference; the generated types are resolved once, not
  per-instance."

## Resolution & the input set

- A relative path resolves against the **referring file's directory**
  (standard base-URI behavior, minus URIs) and is **normalized to an
  absolute path** — `..` segments are *resolved*, not rejected.
  `a/b/x.json` containing `$ref: "../y.json"` resolves to `a/y.json`.
- The **input set** is the transitive closure of local refs reachable
  from the entry file(s)/directory the CLI/API is given, each resolved to
  its absolute path. Every reachable file becomes a per-input output
  module.
- The closure follows a `$ref` **only where a `$ref` is a schema keyword.** A
  dead `$defs` entry counts — it is generated API surface, so its dependencies
  must be in the set — but a `$ref`-shaped key inside a *value* is data, not a
  reference: an object with a `$ref` member appearing in [[examples]], a
  [[default]], a [[const]] or an [[enum]] contributes **no** closure edge.
  Treating it as one enlarges the input set, raises the input root and renames
  every emitted module, which is the opposite of the inertness those keywords
  promise.
- The **input root** is the absolute path of the directory common to all
  resolved input files (their longest common-ancestor directory),
  computed **after** `..` normalization. Module names derive relative to the
  root (see [[generated-file-layout]]); because they are relative to the
  common ancestor they never contain `..`.
- **The root is bounded below by the invocation root** — the common-ancestor
  directory of the entry paths the CLI/API was given (the directory itself when
  one directory is given; the containing directory when one file is). A `$ref`
  that would raise the input root **above** the invocation root is a load
  reject, naming the reference and the directory it escaped to. Without that
  bound a reference can lift the root to an ancestor of the checkout, at which
  point the emitted module tree, Java package names and Go file names encode the
  **absolute filesystem location of the working copy** — so two developers
  generating the same schema get different package names, and a committed
  artifact can never match a colleague's regeneration. An upward `$ref` that
  stays at or below the invocation root is fine and raises the input root as
  usual, so the fix-it is to widen the invocation — name the ancestor directory,
  or name the escaping target as a second entry path — which makes the root the
  author's choice rather than a consequence of where the checkout sits. The
  diagnostic names the `$ref` that escaped, never the entry file that did not
  change, and never a directory outside the working copy (**P7.2**).
  *(Status: unimplemented — the root is currently unbounded above, so an upward
  `$ref` silently lifts it and the emitted layout can encode the checkout's
  absolute path. The bound is the contract; [[generated-file-layout]] and
  [[input-files]] defer to it.)*
- **Reproducible** means exactly that: for a given invocation root, the emitted
  module names, package names and file names are a function of the input files'
  paths *relative to it* and of nothing else — not of where the checkout lives,
  not of the machine. "Local-file-only" (no network fetch) is a separate and
  weaker property, and is not what this bullet promises.
- An **absolute-path `$ref`** is rejected: the accepted-form table above admits
  only `<relative-path>`, and an absolute reference both escapes the invocation
  root and is unreproducible by construction.
  *(Status: unimplemented — an absolute `$ref` currently resolves and is
  followed.)*
- **Dead `$defs`** (defined but never referenced) are still generated and
  exported — they are intended reusable API surface, not waste.

## Type-name derivation

Every accepted `$ref` resolves to a named top-level type. Names are
derived as:

- **File root** → the normalized file **basename** (`user_profile.json`
  → `UserProfile`), overridable by `x-<lang>-name`. A root [[title]] is
  documentation only and never names the type.
  This is distinct from the *module file* name (the flattened full path —
  see [[generated-file-layout]]): `a/user.json` and `b/user.json` yield
  modules `a_user`/`b_user` but both derive type name `User`.
- **`$defs/<Name>`** → `<Name>` run through the shared 4-stage
  JSON-name → identifier algorithm ([[properties]] Identifier mapping).
- **Anonymous inline** subschemas promoted to types → existing synthesis
  rules ([[const]]/[[enum]]/[[properties]]; nest where the language
  allows, P15 backstop).

A type's emitted name is resolved once for the **whole input closure**, so
a reference from another input file names exactly the identifier the
declaring file's own module emits — including its `x-<lang>-name`
override, which the referencing file does not restate.

**Collision.** For Go, TypeScript and Python all type names occupy **one
package-wide namespace** — Go flattens to a single package, and the TypeScript
and Python barrels re-aggregate every module into one. Java and .NET resolve
per module instead, so there the namespace is the module
([[generated-file-layout]]). A collision → **load reject, no mangling**;
the escape hatch is `x-<lang>-name` (**P15**, scope widened from per-object to
per-package). Consistent with [[properties]],
**collisions are evaluated per emitted target only** — a name set may be
accepted for a Go-only run and rejected for a Java run, because
normalization differs per language.

**The derived name is the model's identity.** The one collision that is
*not* per-target is a file-root type and a same-file `$defs` entry that
derive the **same** name (`thing.yaml` with a root type plus
`$defs.Thing`): the derived name is the identity every `$ref` resolves
through and every target emits one type for, so the two schemas would
otherwise collapse into one — the loser's shape dropped and every
reference to it silently retargeted at the winner. It is rejected for
**every** target, and the fix-it is a rename of the `$defs` key or of the
file the root name derives from; an `x-<lang>-name` override does not
resolve it, because it moves one target's *emitted identifier* and leaves
both schemas on the one identity. A name **synthesized** for an inline
shape ([[properties]]) is held to the same rule — a hoisted `$defs` entry
whose name equals the root type's is rejected where the shape is hoisted,
with a diagnostic naming the position it was written in. A file with no
root type (a definitions-only file or a Nexus document — see
[[input-files]]) has no root name to collide with.

**A sibling fold is a new declaration.** Every sibling of a `$ref` outside the
two non-conjunct classes folds ([[allOf]]), and the merged node is a standalone
type named from its **position** — the annotation text never supplies the name.
So adding a [[title]] or [[description]] beside a `$ref`, an edit that changes
neither the wire nor any validation, introduces a new package-level identifier
that can collide. Because the identifier is synthesized rather than authored,
**P7.2** applied here yields two obligations, and together they are what makes
such an edit safe to make:

- the reject must name the **position that synthesized** the identifier — the
  annotated reference — and not only the two colliding names, so the author can
  see which edit caused it;
- **every remedy it offers must resolve the reject.** "Extract the target into
  `$defs` and reference it" is no remedy when that is exactly what the author
  already wrote, and `x-<lang>-name` is one only if applying it **at the site
  the author edited** reaches the synthesized name (**P15**). Removing the
  annotation always resolves it, so a diagnostic that cannot offer an
  applicable override must offer that.

## Output layout

The full package structure (file names, the shared `definitions` file,
the Python-only `_recursive.py`, the `__init__.py`/`index.ts`
aggregators, single- vs multi-input collapse, the flattened
path-to-module encoding) is specified in **[[generated-file-layout]]**.
The `$ref`-relevant summary:

- One generated package tree per language, flat for Go and mirroring the input
  tree for Python, TypeScript, and Java; one module per input file
  ([[generated-file-layout]]).
- Reference cycles that span ≥2 input files **hoist** their
  strongly-connected types into a shared module (Python `_recursive.py`;
  TS/Go/Java handle cycles natively).
- This **refines P14**: "merge on cycle" means *hoist the cyclic types*,
  not *merge whole input files*.

## Recursion & satisfiability

**Reference graph.** Nodes = named types (file roots, `$defs`, promoted
anonymous). Edge A→B whenever A's schema `$ref`s B (in a property,
`items`, `additionalProperties`, …). Compute strongly-connected
components (SCCs); a non-trivial SCC (or a self-loop) is a recursion
cycle. A cycle spanning ≥2 input files is the cross-file SCC that hoists
to `_recursive.py` (Python only — see [[generated-file-layout]]).

**Per-language emission of a cyclic back-edge:**

| Language | Recursive field | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Go** | pointer `*T` (even when required + non-nullable) | a bare recursive `T` is an infinitely-sized struct (compile error); `[]T`/`map[string]T` already carry indirection |
| **Java** | bare reference | object fields are references already; recursion is free |
| **TypeScript** | bare reference | interfaces reference themselves/each other freely |
| **Python** | bare reference | `from __future__ import annotations` makes every annotation a string that is never evaluated, so a dataclass references itself and its cycle peers freely; the emitted order is topological only for readability |

**Satisfiability check.** A recursion cycle has a finite instance only if
**at least one edge in it can terminate**. An edge *terminates* when it
is:
- **optional** (member not in `required`) — absence ends the chain;
- **required + nullable** (the [[nullability]] `oneOf` null pattern) —
  `null` ends it;
- **collection-wrapped** (`items` / `additionalProperties` valued by the
  `$ref`) — the empty array/object ends it.

If **every** edge in a cycle is mandatory-and-single-valued (required +
non-nullable + not collection-wrapped), no finite instance exists →
**load reject**. The diagnostic names the cycle path (`A → B → A`) and
the three fixes (make an edge optional, nullable, or wrap it in an
array). A direct required-non-nullable self-ref (`{"$ref":"#"}` member)
is the degenerate case. This implements the rows [[properties]] reserved
("unsatisfiable direct self-reference"). The check is decidable and
conservative — it never rejects a satisfiable schema.

## Per-language `$ref` emission

A field `{"x": {"$ref": "#/$defs/Foo"}}` emits a field `x` of type
`Foo`. Optional/nullable wrapping layers on top per [[nullability]];
the recursion-pointer rule above applies to cyclic edges. Imports follow
[[generated-file-layout]]:

- **Python** — `from .b import Foo`, `from ._recursive import Node`, plus
  imports of the shared `Violation` and payload-validation helper from the
  package's private `_definitions` module where validation is emitted.
- **TypeScript** — `import type { Foo } from './b'`, plus
  `import { fooTransferTypeConverter } from './b'` since the referencing
  type's converter delegates to the target's (PRINCIPLES TS §4).
- **Go** — same flat package; no import.
- **Java** — same-package references need no import in a single-input run;
  cross-file references import the target from its per-input sub-package.

**Bare-`$ref` alias.** *(Status: unimplemented — a bare-`$ref` root
is currently loaded as "not a model": nothing is emitted for it in any
language, and a `$ref` from another file to that root fails to resolve. A
bare-`$ref` `$defs` entry is collected as a model and emitted as an object with
**no members**, which loses the target's whole shape and makes the four targets
disagree on the same payload; that is not a licensed outcome under either
reading below. The rules below are the intended design.)* A **schema that is
exactly `{"$ref": <target>}`** — a file root or a `$defs` entry — is an
**alias** for the target: every position that references the alias denotes the
target's shape, including an operation's `input`/`output` ([[services]]), and no
shapeless type is emitted. Where the language supports an alias declaration it
is emitted as one:

| Language | Emission |
|---|---|
| **Go** | `type A = Main` (alias; fully interchangeable) |
| **TypeScript** | `export type A = Main` |
| **Python** | `A = Main` (module-level alias) |
| **Java** | **no alias** — every reference to the bare-ref schema resolves directly to the target `Main`; no synthesized `A` |

The Java asymmetry is cosmetic and *safe by construction*: since `A` is
nothing but another name for `Main`, collapsing all references to `Main`
yields one interchangeable type at every site — and it is what makes the
operation-I/O gate sound: whatever proves the alias object-shaped is the
target's shape, so the operation must be typed on the target, never on a
distinct shapeless `A`. Subclassing
(`A extends Main`) is **rejected** as the Java realization — it would
require dropping `final` from value types, a duplicated per-class
collecting deserializer, and would split reference sites into
incompatible `A`-typed and `Main`-typed slots (a `Main` value cannot be
assigned to an `A` field).

## Validator / serializer (P12)

`$ref` is pure delegation: validating a field typed `Foo` calls `Foo`'s
own shared `Validate` (mirror-image on both directions). Composite types
recurse into their referenced types' validators; for cyclic types the
recursion is bounded by the (finite) data. No `$ref`-specific runtime
helper is emitted — the named-type machinery already in place
([[type]], [[properties]]) does the work.

## Property-testing matrix

### Accepted (positive)

| Case | Form |
|---|---|
| Same-file named def | `{"$ref": "#/$defs/Address"}` |
| Whole-document root | `{"$ref": "#"}` (terminating edge present) |
| Cross-file root | `{"$ref": "common.json"}` |
| Cross-file named def | `{"$ref": "common.json#/$defs/Money"}` |
| Pointer-escaped name | `{"$ref": "#/$defs/foo~1bar"}` → def `foo/bar` |
| Direct self-ref, optional | `{value:{type:string}, next:{$ref:"#"}}`, `required:[value]` (linked list) |
| Self-ref via array, required | `{value:{...}, children:{type:array, items:{$ref:"#"}}}` (tree) |
| Mutual cross-file cycle | `a.json#/X` ↔ `b.json#/Y` with a terminating edge → hoisted to `_recursive` (Py) |
| Dead `$defs` | a `$defs` entry never referenced → still emitted/exported |
| Bare-`$ref` root (**unimplemented**) | file root `{"$ref":"#/$defs/Main"}` → alias (Go/TS/Py), `Main` (Java) |
| Bare-`$ref` `$defs` entry (**unimplemented**) | `$defs.Alias: {"$ref":"#/$defs/Target"}` → alias for `Target`, never an empty model |
| `$ref` with siblings | `{"$ref":"#/$defs/X", "minProperties":1}` → implicit `allOf`, merged ([[allOf]]) |
| `$ref` with a non-conjunct sibling | `{"$ref":"#/$defs/X", "$comment":"note"}`, `{"$ref":"#/$defs/X", "deprecated":true}` → reference kept, no synthesized type |

### Rejected at load time (negative)

| Case | Reason |
|---|---|
| Pointer into non-`$defs` | `{"$ref": "#/properties/x/items"}` — not nameable (P7) |
| `$id` present | any position — root, nested, or an [[allOf]] conjunct — no URI resolution (local-file-only) |
| HTTP ref | `{"$ref": "https://example.com/s.json"}` — not local (local-file-only) |
| Absolute-path ref (**unimplemented**) | `{"$ref": "/abs/other.json"}` — only `<relative-path>` is an accepted form |
| Ref escaping the invocation root (**unimplemented**) | a `$ref` that raises the input root above the entry path — the layout would encode the checkout's location |
| `$defs` outside a model position (**unimplemented**) | a `$defs` bucket under a property, `items`, `additionalProperties`, a [[oneOf]] branch or a [[contains]] matcher — unreachable by any `$ref` |
| `$anchor` / `$dynamicRef` / `$dynamicAnchor` | not in subset (P6) — see Anchors & dynamic references |
| Unresolvable | missing file or missing `$defs` entry |
| Unsatisfiable cycle | every edge required + non-nullable + single-valued |
| Type-name collision | two targets → same identifier in an emitted language (per-target, P15) |
| Root/`$defs` name coincidence | a file-root type and a same-file `$defs` entry — authored or synthesized for an inline shape — derive the same name: one identity, two schemas (all targets, P15) |
| Module-name collision | two inputs flatten to the same module name ([[generated-file-layout]]) |

### Runtime fixtures (validator)

- A valid nested instance round-trips: parse → validate (delegated to the
  referenced type) → serialize, unchanged.
- A recursive instance (linked list / tree) of arbitrary finite depth
  validates; the terminating edge (absent / `null` / empty array) ends
  the chain.
- An invalid value at a referenced position pushes a `Violation` whose
  path includes the nested location, aggregated with sibling errors (P11).

## Interactions

- **[[properties]]** — a member schema may be a `$ref`; the recursion
  matrix rows there are realized here. Type-name synthesis shares the
  identifier algorithm.
- **[[nullability]]** — optional/nullable wrapping of a `$ref` field;
  required + nullable is a terminating edge.
- **[[required]]** — owns which `$ref` edges are optional (a primary
  source of cycle termination).
- **[[const]]** / **[[enum]]** — a `$defs` whose name a synthesized
  type reuses (the Go defined type / Java value class) enters the same
  per-package namespace (P15).
- **[[additionalProperties]]** — a `$ref`-valued catch-all/typed map is a
  collection-wrapped (terminating) edge.
- **[[generated-file-layout]]** — owns the package structure this spec
  references.
- **[[services]]** — an operation's `input`/`output` is a `$ref` to a
  `$defs` type or an inline schema promoted to a synthesized
  `<Op>Input`/`Output` type; both join this spec's reference graph and
  type-name namespace.

## Ecosystem variance

| Source | Handling |
|---|---|
| draft-07 (`$ref` siblings ignored) | siblings are **merged** as an implicit `allOf` per 2020-12 ([[allOf]]), not dropped — a stricter, more faithful reading (the one cross-draft behavior change), the two non-conjunct classes above excepted. A draft-07 author who intended the siblings as dead keys will see them take effect; remove them to restore the old meaning |
| `definitions` (draft-07 keyword) | not recognized; require `$defs`. Diagnostic suggests renaming `definitions` → `$defs` |
| `$id`-rebased refs (OpenAPI/JSON-Schema bundlers) | reject; the input must be a flat local-file tree resolvable by path + pointer |
| `$anchor` / `$dynamicRef` | reject (P6); not in the subset |
