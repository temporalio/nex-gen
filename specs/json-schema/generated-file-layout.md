# Generated file layout (cross-cutting design note)

Not a JSON Schema keyword. Specifies how a set of input schema files
becomes generated source in each language: the package structure, file
names, where shared runtime lives, and how reference cycles and name
collisions are handled at the file level. Driven by **P14** (one module
per input file; merge recursion, not files) and local-file-only external
refs; the reference semantics that feed it live in [[ref]].

## Output mirrors the input directory tree (Python / TypeScript / Java)

Each input schema file `<subpath>/<name>.<ext>` becomes a **per-input
module directory** `<subpath>/<name>/` under the output package root,
preserving the input directory structure verbatim — **directories are not
flattened**. Inside each per-input directory:

- `models.<lang>` — the domain types declared in that file (its root type
  and every `$defs`).
- `services.<lang>` — the Nexus service bindings declared in that file,
  emitted **only if it declares any** (see [[services]]).

Schema-independent runtime — `Violation`, any target-owned payload-validation
compatibility helper, the spec-number helpers, and the (de)serialize scaffolding — is defined **once**
at the package root (the shared `definitions` file, below), never
duplicated per module.

Nesting works because each of these languages maps an input directory onto
its native module unit:

- **Python** — a subpackage directory carrying an `__init__.py`.
- **TypeScript** — a directory with an `index.ts` barrel.
- **Java** — a package mirroring the directory, one `.java` per public
  class.

Cross-directory mutual references are supported: Python hoists the cyclic
types into `_recursive.py` (Recursion, below), TypeScript relies on
cycle-safe `import type` and call-time live bindings, and Java on object
references. Because each input file's types live in their own module, type
names only need to be unique **within** that module (see Collisions and
[[ref]]).

## Go flattens to one package

**Go is the exception.** Every input file in a generator run collapses
into **one flat package** — nested input directories are not mirrored. A
Go package cannot participate in an import cycle, so if two directories
became two packages a **cross-directory mutual reference** would be an
illegal cyclic import, and Go has no cross-package hoist like Python's
`_recursive`. Flattening to a single package makes every reference —
including a cross-directory cycle — a **within-package** reference, which
the Go compiler resolves natively. It is also what lets the
schema-independent boilerplate be defined **once** in that package instead
of per file.

Within the one package, each input file emits a `<module>.go` whose name
is its flattened path (Module paths, below), plus a shared `definitions.go`.
Because everything shares one namespace, type and module names cannot
collide across files — the loader validates this (see Collisions).

## The single-input special case

When the closure is **exactly one input file**, there is no directory tree
to mirror: the file's output lands **directly at the package root** rather
than in a per-input subdirectory. A single `chat.yaml` → package `chat/`
holding `models.py`, `services.py`, the shared `_definitions.py`, and the
`__init__.py` aggregator side by side. No per-input subdirectory, and no
`_recursive` (a cross-file cycle is impossible with one file). The
models/services split and the shared-runtime file are still present in
every language, Go included: Go always emits the one input's `<package>.go`
alongside its own `definitions.go`, the same shared-runtime layout it uses
for multi-input closures.

## Files per language

### Multi-input (≥2 input files in the closure)

Per input file `<subpath>/<name>`:

| Language | Per-input module | Shared runtime (once) | Recursive module | Aggregator |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Python** | `<subpath>/<name>/models.py` (+ `services.py` if it declares services) | `_definitions.py` (package root) | `_recursive.py` (package root) | `__init__.py` per directory — the per-input directory, every intermediate directory, and the package root |
| **TypeScript** | `<subpath>/<name>/models.ts` (+ `services.ts`) | `definitions.ts` (package root) | — | `index.ts` per directory (barrels chain upward) |
| **Go** | `<module>.go` in the one flat package (`<module>` = flattened path) | `definitions.go` (same package) | — | — (capitalized = exported) |
| **Java** | one `<ClassName>.java` per exported class, in a package mirroring `<subpath>/<name>/` | each runtime class its own file in the root package (`Violation.java`, `SpecNumbers.java`, …) | — | — (`public` = exported) |

**A module emits only the types its own input file declares.** A type reached by
`$ref` into another file belongs to the module that declares it, and is imported
from there — never re-emitted into the referencing module, which would put a
second copy of the type in the package (a redeclaration in Go's flat package, a
duplicate class file in Java, an import-versus-local-declaration conflict in
TypeScript, and a shadowed re-import in Python). A service file whose every
operation type is `$ref`d from elsewhere therefore declares nothing of its own,
and emits no models file at all — for TypeScript that also means its `index.ts`
does not re-export `./models`, since a barrel re-exporting a file with no exports
is itself an error (`TS2306`).

**`_recursive` is Python-only and is a single file at the package root**
(`<package>/_recursive.py`), **never** per-input. It holds every hoisted
cross-file SCC in the whole closure. See Recursion below.

### Single-input (exactly one input file — no cross-file refs possible)

All output lands at the package root (no per-input subdirectory, no
`_recursive`):

| Language | Output |
|---|---|
| **Python** | `models.py` (+ `services.py`), the shared `_definitions.py`, and the `__init__.py` aggregator — the same split as multi-input, flattened to the package root |
| **TypeScript** | `models.ts` (+ `services.ts`), `definitions.ts`, `index.ts` |
| **Go** | one `<package>.go` (types and services) + the shared `definitions.go` |
| **Java** | one `.java` per public class + the runtime classes; nothing to aggregate |

## The shared `definitions` file

Holds the schema-independent runtime, defined once per package
(`_definitions.py` / `definitions.ts` / `definitions.go`; Java splits it into
one class file each). For Python/TypeScript/Java it sits at the package root;
for Go it sits in the one flat package, always as its own `definitions.go`
file regardless of how many input files that package aggregates. Python's
file is underscore-prefixed, the language's own marking for a module that is
generator-internal rather than part of the package's surface.

- Payload-validation failure construction — each target raises the SDK's
  non-retryable application failure (`ApplicationFailure` in TypeScript/Java,
  `ApplicationError` in Python/Go) with message `Payload validation failed`,
  type `PayloadValidationError`, and the language's `Violation` list as its
  first detail. Python calls
  `temporalio.converter.create_payload_validation_error` directly and requires
  Temporal SDK 1.32.0 or newer. The generated TypeScript and Go helpers carry
  TODOs to use their corresponding SDK factories once those factories are
  available in supported releases. Java inlines the application-failure call
  with the equivalent TODO at each throw site. Nested aggregation casts the
  locally retained first detail back to the generated violation-list type; the
  cast is cheap and performs no serialization (P11).
- Spec-number helpers — `parseSpecInteger` (Go), `_parse_spec_integer`
  (Python), `SpecNumbers.specLong` (Java), TS's safe-integer check.
- Shared (de)serialize scaffolding — the **P12** three-layer base: the
  temporal and content-encoding parse/format helpers, the constraint
  checks both directions call, and the helper that re-paths a nested
  violation list under its parent field (Python `_collect`, TS
  `collect`). Python additionally keeps its `_transfer_type_convertible`
  decorator shim here, so the value-type erasure each model registers
  through is written once rather than per model. The per-model conversion
  machinery stays with its type —
  Python's transfer-type converter, Java's collecting (de)serializer —
  but the shared `Violation`, payload-validation helper, and `SpecNumbers`
  runtime live here.

## Module paths

The **input root** is the absolute path of the directory common to all
resolved input files (their longest common-ancestor directory). `$ref`
paths are resolved to absolute paths first — `..` segments are normalized,
not rejected ([[ref]]) — so a ref that walks upward simply raises the
common root.

**Python / TypeScript / Java** preserve each input file's directory path
**relative to the input root** verbatim under the package root, with the
filename (minus extension) becoming the leaf per-input directory:

```
input root = /abs/schemas   (common ancestor of all resolved inputs)

/abs/schemas/kb.yaml               -> kb/            (models.py, services.py)
/abs/schemas/content/block.json    -> content/block/ (models.py)
/abs/schemas/tree/category.json    -> tree/category/ (models.py)
```

"Minus extension" strips `.json` / `.yaml` / `.yml` **and then a trailing
`.nexusrpc` infix**, so `chat.nexusrpc.yaml` is the module `chat`, not
`chat.nexusrpc` — the convention marker names the file, not the generated
package, and a `.` in a module segment would be unspellable as a Python or
Java package name anyway. The same stripping produces the file's derived
root type name. A consequence worth stating outright: `chat.yaml` and
`chat.nexusrpc.yaml` in one closure map to the **same** module path and
collide (a load reject, per *Collisions* below); a closure may name a
module once, in one spelling.

Because the directory structure is mirrored rather than collapsed, there
is no delimiter to escape and no path-encoding scheme: literal
underscores, nested directories, and repeated segments all survive
unchanged.

**Go** flattens each file's path (relative to the input root, minus
extension) into a single `<module>.go` name, replacing the directory
delimiter with `_` and **preserving literal underscores verbatim** — no
escaping. Because module names are relative to the common ancestor, they
never contain `..`:

```
/abs/schemas/full_name.json       -> full_name.go
/abs/schemas/a/b/user.json        -> a_b_user.go
/abs/schemas/billing/invoice.json -> billing_invoice.go
```

Type names are directory-independent (basename-of-root or `$defs` name —
see [[ref]]), so they do not encode the path.

### Why Go does not escape

Identifiers are `[A-Za-z0-9_]`: two structural things (the directory
separator and a literal `_`) must encode into one non-alphanumeric
character. Injective + flat + underscores-preserved is impossible without
escaping. We choose **readable + collision-reject** over an escaping
scheme: keep names clean and reject the rare collision, consistent with
the **P15** "reject loudly, never mangle, offer an override" stance used
everywhere else. Go's flattened `.go` files are internal organization
anyway — consumers import types from the package by name — so a rare
reject costs little.

## Collisions

**Go** — one unified namespace per package holds the **reserved generated
names** (`definitions` and `_definitions`, the union across languages) plus one
entry per input module. Any collision
in that namespace → **load reject** with a fix-it. The fix-it is **rename
the input file or directory**; a per-input `x-output-module` override is a
*possible* future escape hatch and is **not implemented** — nothing in the
generator reads such a keyword today, and there is no per-module escape
hatch at all (`x-<lang>-name` names types and members, not modules):

- two inputs flattening to the same module (`full/name` vs `full_name`);
- an input flattening onto a reserved generated name (a root-level
  `definitions.json`);
- a **type name** declared by two different input files — `a/page.json`
  and `b/page.json` both emitting `Page` is one redeclaration in the flat
  package, so Go's collision scope is the whole run rather than the module
  (see [[ref]] and PRINCIPLES §15); the diagnostic names both modules.
  TypeScript and Python reject the same closure, by way of their barrels
  rather than a flat package — see below;
- a generated **service binding** colliding with a model (or synthesized
  I/O) type — service `ChatService` against a `$defs/ChatService`; see
  [[services]], which shares this one namespace.

**Python / TypeScript / Java / .NET** — nesting keeps distinct input files in
distinct modules, so files no longer contend for one flat *module* name. What
remains is a small set of **reserved generated names** per scope; an input
file or directory that maps onto one → load reject with the same fix-it:

- at the **package root**: the shared runtime module — **both** spellings,
  `definitions` (Go/TypeScript) and `_definitions` (Python), are reserved in
  every target, the union across languages, so an input named either way
  rejects regardless of which target is being generated — plus `_recursive`
  (Python) and the root aggregator (`__init__` / `index`);
- within a **per-input directory**: `models`, `services`, and that
  directory's own aggregator.

Distinct modules do **not**, however, buy every target a distinct *type*
namespace, because two of them re-aggregate:

- **TypeScript and Python** emit a root barrel that lifts every module's
  top-level names into one namespace — `index.ts` re-exports each module with
  `export *`, `__init__.py` re-exports them by name — so a type name declared
  by two input files collides there and is rejected run-wide, exactly as in
  Go's flat package. Left to the target, TypeScript rejects the barrel
  (`TS2308`, "has already exported a member named `Page`") and Python silently
  binds whichever import runs last, dropping the other model off the package
  surface — the silent incorrectness P7 forbids. Names synthesized beside a
  type travel with it, so TypeScript's `<model>TransferTypeConverter` collides
  in the same breath as the interface.
- **Java and .NET** give each module its own sub-package/namespace
  (`com.example.api.content.page`, `Nexgen.Generated.Content.Page`) and emit
  no aggregating barrel, so two input files may each declare a `Page` and stay
  unambiguous. Their scope really is the module.

Within a single module's exported namespace the type/service/synthesized-name
collision surface is unchanged (service `ChatService` in `services.py`
against a `$defs/ChatService` in `models.py` share the per-input
directory's one exported namespace — see [[services]]; synthesized names
per [[ref]]).

Like [[properties]], collisions are evaluated **per emitted target only** —
normalization differs per language.

## Recursion: hoist types, not files

This is the file-level realization of **P14**. "Merge on cycle" does
**not** mean merge whole input files — it means hoist only the cyclic
types:

- Build the reference graph and its strongly-connected components
  ([[ref]]). An SCC spanning **≥2 input files** is a cross-file cycle.
- **Python**: the cross-file SCC moves wholesale into `_recursive.py` at
  the package root, where it becomes a within-module cycle (topological
  order + a forward-ref back-edge in the annotation). It imports the
  leaf, non-cyclic types it needs from the per-input modules, and
  **nothing imports back into it from below**: the hoisted classes are
  re-exported by the **package-root `__init__.py` only**. A per-input
  module — or its `__init__.py` — importing them back would recreate
  exactly the cycle the hoist exists to break (`_recursive` imports
  `content.page.models`, whose package `__init__` would in turn import
  `_recursive`). So a hoisted type is reached as `from kb import Page`,
  never `from kb.content.page import Page`, and the cross-module import
  cycle is gone. The hoist is what makes the cycle
  tractable: a per-input module names its siblings' classes in
  **module-level `import` statements**, which is a real Python import
  cycle no annotation treatment can defuse. A cycle **within** a single
  file stays in its module.
- **TypeScript**: no recursive file. Type references erase
  (`import type` is always cycle-safe), and the imported *values* — a
  sibling model's transfer type converter, a validator function — are ESM
  live bindings read at call time, not module-init. A converter is
  instantiated at module-init, but the sibling converters it delegates to
  are named only inside its method bodies, so a mutually-referencing pair
  initializes in either order. Every other generated const is a
  self-contained leaf literal. So there is no init-order hazard, and cyclic
  types stay in their per-input modules.
- **Go**: no recursive file — the single flat package makes every cycle
  (same-file or cross-directory) a within-package reference, which Go
  resolves natively. This is exactly why Go flattens (above).
- **Java**: object references handle cycles natively across packages. No
  recursive file.

**Python: annotations are lazy, union assignments are not.** Generated
modules open with `from __future__ import annotations`, so every
annotation is stored as a string and never evaluated — a dataclass field
may name a class defined later in the same module, and a *class* cycle
therefore needs no fix-up step of any kind once the SCC shares a module.
A named union is the exception, because it is an assignment rather than
an annotation: the right-hand side of
`Note: typing.TypeAlias = TextNote | LinkNote` is an ordinary expression
evaluated when the module runs, so its members must already exist and
**unions are emitted after every class they reference**. That ordering
constraint is the only intra-module one; it is orthogonal to the
cross-module hoist above.

## Exports / visibility

*Public* = every top-level named type (file roots + all `$defs`,
including dead ones; anonymous types stay nested) plus each file's service
bindings:

- **Python** — each per-input `__init__.py` re-exports its module's public
  types (and services) via `__all__` — **except** types hoisted into
  `_recursive.py`, which would reintroduce the broken cycle; each
  intermediate directory's `__init__.py` re-exports its children; the
  package-root `__init__.py` re-exports the whole tree, and is the **only**
  place the hoisted types surface, pulled from `_recursive`. The
  package root also exports the shared `Violation`; generated model modules
  call the SDK's payload-validation factory directly.
- **TypeScript** — `index.ts` per directory: per-input barrels
  `export … from './models'` (and `./services`), intermediate barrels
  `export * from './<child>'`, and the root barrel re-exports the tree plus
  the runtime's `payloadValidationError` compatibility helper and the
  `Violation` type from `./definitions`.
- **Go** — no aggregator; capitalized identifiers are exported from the one
  flat package.
- **Java** — `public` class per file; runtime classes public too.

## Service bindings

A Nexus service ([[services]]) emits into a **`services.<lang>` file in the
same per-input directory** as the models declared in that file (Python/TS),
sharing that directory's one exported namespace and the P15 collision pass
with the file's types and the synthesized operation `<Op>Input`/`<Op>Output`
types. **Go** emits the service into its flat package alongside the models
(Go has no models/services split). **Java** emits each service as its own
`<Service>.java`, like each model class. Aggregators (`index.ts` /
`__init__.py`) re-export services alongside models.
