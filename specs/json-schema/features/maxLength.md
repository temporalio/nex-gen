# `maxLength`

Source: JSON Schema 2020-12, Validation vocabulary, §6.3.1
"Validation Keywords for Strings → maxLength".

Sets an **inclusive** upper bound on the **length of a string** instance,
where length is the count of Unicode **code points** (RFC 8259), *not*
bytes, UTF-16 code units, or grapheme clusters. A pure runtime assertion —
no type impact. The canonical spec for the string-length pair;
[[minLength]] shares the machinery documented here and differs only in the
comparison operator. The one string-length hazard is that the naive
"length" primitive counts the **wrong unit** in three of the four targets
(Go bytes, TS/Java UTF-16 units) — so the shared predicate is pinned to a
code-point count, verified across all four targets.

## Spec summary

Verbatim (2020-12 validation, §6.3.1):

> The value of this keyword MUST be a non-negative integer.

> A string instance is valid against this keyword if its length is less
> than, or exactly equal to, the value of this keyword.

> The length of a string instance is defined as the number of its
> characters as defined by RFC 8259.

Distilled:
- Value MUST be a **non-negative integer**.
- Instance valid iff `codePointCount(instance) ≤ maxLength`.
- "Number of characters as defined by RFC 8259" = number of **Unicode
  code points** (RFC 8259 §7 defines a JSON string as a sequence of
  Unicode code points). **No normalization** is applied: precomposed `é`
  (NFC, `U+00E9`) is length 1, decomposed `é` (NFD, `e`+`U+0301`) is
  length 2 — and every target agrees on each, because none normalizes.
- Applies **only** to string instances; the spec silently ignores it for
  non-strings. Per **P7.1** we instead reject a `maxLength` on a
  non-string [[type]] at load time.
- Pure assertion; no annotation behavior.

## Support decision

**Support:** yes — runtime code-point-count comparison.

Lowers to a single length comparison in every language; no effect on
emitted types. Citing [[PRINCIPLES.md]]: **P1** (the count must be
*identical* across all four — the crux, see below), **P10** (enforced at
the boundary), **P11** (aggregated), **P12** (a pure predicate over the
decoded value in the **shared `Validate`** layer — identical in both
directions, no parse/encode adapter logic of its own).

**The P1 crux — count code points, not the native "length".** The naive
per-language length primitive counts a different unit in three of the four
targets, so a schema like `{type:"string", maxLength:3}` against the
4-byte / 2-UTF-16-unit / 3-code-point string `"a😀b"` would *disagree*
value-for-value if each language used its default. Verified in
`string_probe` (`"a😀b"`): Go `len` = **6** (UTF-8 bytes), JS `.length`
= **4** and Java `.length()` = **4** (UTF-16 code units), Python `len`
= **3** (code points). Only the code-point count (3) is spec-correct and
portable, so the shared predicate is pinned to it and each language uses
its code-point-counting primitive (table below), **never** the bare
`len`/`.length`. This is the string analog of [[multipleOf]]'s
"standardize on the portable operation across all four" decision.

Loader behavior:
- Value not a non-negative integer → reject: a non-number
  (`maxLength:"5"`, `maxLength:true`, `maxLength:null`), a **negative**
  value (`maxLength:-1`), or a **fractional** value (`maxLength:5.5`).
  `maxLength:5.0` is accepted (≡ `5`, honoring the `1.0`-as-integer rule
  from [[type]]).
- The portable count ceiling from [[maxItems]] applies.
- `maxLength` on a non-string [[type]] (`{type:"integer", maxLength:5}`) →
  reject per **P7.1** (statically meaningless — the array-length analog is
  `maxItems`, the member-count analog is [[maxProperties]]).
- **`minLength` > `maxLength` on the same node → reject (unsatisfiable).**
  `minLength == maxLength` pins an **exact** length (accepted — a
  fixed-width string). See **Interactions → satisfiability**.
- A `const`/`default`/`enum` string literal on the **same node** whose
  code-point length exceeds `maxLength` → reject at load. This closes, for
  the string-length constraints, the "validate the literal against
  constraint keywords" obligation the [[const]] and [[default]] specs
  deferred (e.g. `{type:"string", maxLength:2, const:"abc"}` is a load
  reject).

## Type mapping

None. The bound lives only in the validator and never changes the emitted
field type — [[type]]'s `string`, unless a materializing sibling
([[format]] temporal / [[contentEncoding]] bytes) governs it (the bound
then checks the encoded wire string).

## Validator mapping

Per **P10**/**P11**. A single `≤` comparison of the **code-point count**
against the fixed bound, identical in both directions (a pure predicate
over the decoded value — the **shared `Validate`** layer of **P12**). The
per-language row differs only in how it counts code points; all four are
verified equal in `string_probe`. Go/Python/Java lean on a stdlib
primitive (`utf8.RuneCountInString` / `len` / `codePointCount`); TS has no
allocation-free code-point-count primitive, so it emits a small
surrogate-aware scan once as a shared `codePointLength` helper and, for the
length assertions, **early-exits against the bound** rather than counting
the whole string (see the TS row).

| Language | Strategy |
|---|---|
| Go | The comparison is a predicate in the shared `Validate(model)` (`if n := utf8.RuneCountInString(v); n > max { push(Violation{Path, Reason: fmt.Sprintf("must have length <= %d, got %d", max, n)}) }`), which the generated `UnmarshalJSON` calls after decoding; violations collect into one `PayloadValidationError` application failure. **`utf8.RuneCountInString`, not `len`** — `len` is the UTF-8 byte count (verified `len("a😀b") == 6`). |
| TypeScript | An **allocation-free** surrogate-aware pass that **early-exits** the moment the bound is crossed: walk `v` by UTF-16 unit counting code points (each well-formed high+low surrogate pair is one code point), and stop as soon as the running count exceeds `max`. On the (rare) failure path compute the exact count with the shared `codePointLength(v)` helper for the message: ``push(Violation{path, reason: `must have length <= ${max}, got ${codePointLength(v)}`})``; throw one `PayloadValidationError` application failure. **Never `v.length`** — that is the UTF-16 code-unit count (verified `"a😀b".length === 4`). `max` is an emitted numeric constant. This beats the obvious `[...v].length` (which allocates a full code-point array) ~3.5×, and early-exit bounds work on adversarially long input regardless of `max`. |
| Python | `if (n := len(v)) > max: violations.append(Violation(path=…, reason=f"must have length <= {max}, got {n}"))` in the transfer type converter (PRINCIPLES Python §3). **`len` on a `str` is the code-point count** — a single astral emoji is 1 code point but 4 UTF-8 bytes / 2 UTF-16 units (`len("a😀b") == 3`) — so it is spec-correct with no extra scan, matching the other three. Aggregates into the single generated `PayloadValidationError` application failure. |
| Java | The per-POJO collecting deserializer (PRINCIPLES Java §5) reads the field node as a `String`, then checks `int n = v.codePointCount(0, v.length()); if (n > max)`, pushing a `Violation{path, "must have length <= " + max + ", got " + n}` into the single `PayloadValidationError` application failure. **`codePointCount(0, length())`, not `length()`** — `length()` is the UTF-16 code-unit count (verified `"a😀b".length() == 4`). Not bean-validation `@Size` — the check is hand-written in the collecting deserializer like every other constraint. |

**Informative `reason` strings.** The `Violation` `reason` names the
**concrete bound and the offending count** — `must have length <= 2, got 3`
— per the [[maximum]] convention, so the aggregated error tells the caller
which limit was crossed and by how much. The bound is an emitted
compile-time constant; the count is computed at runtime.

### Serialize-side (P12)

The bound is a shared-`Validate` predicate, so it **re-runs before emit**
over the decoded value — a model constructed with an over-length string
(a Go `string` / Java `String` / Python `str` set past `maxLength` in
memory) fails serialize with the same aggregated primitive rather than
emitting an out-of-bounds value. Real teeth in the statically-typed
targets, where in-memory construction is unchecked (identical rationale to
the [[type]] integer-cap re-check and the [[maximum]] bound re-check). No
parse-adapter-only or encode-adapter-only logic: the comparison is pure
and direction-agnostic.

**On a materialized node** ([[format]] temporal / [[contentEncoding]]
bytes) the decoded value is not a `string`, so the bound is a predicate
over the **canonical wire string** instead: on parse it checks the
incoming wire string, and on serialize it checks the wire string the
encode adapter re-serializes the native value to, **before emit** — so the
teeth hold there too (an in-memory bytes value whose base64 exceeds
`maxLength`, or a temporal whose canonical form does, fails serialize).
Still one predicate, still identical in both directions; the wire string
is simply projected from the native value on the encode side.
**Which string, precisely — and it is *not* the incoming one.** "Canonical wire
string" means the form the encode adapter produces for that value, and the
assertion measures **that** form at both boundaries. On parse this means the
predicate runs **after** the value has been parsed and re-canonicalized, not
against the bytes as they arrived. The distinction is invisible for a format
with a single spelling and decisive for one without: `PT90M` and `PT1H30M` are
the same [[format]] `duration`, they canonicalize to `PT1H30M`, and they differ
in length and in what a regex matches.

Measuring the incoming form on parse and the canonical form on serialize would
make "identical in both directions" false — a payload could be admitted and then
be unre-emittable, which is a **P1** accept-set defect, not a rounding of it.

The same rule governs a **literal** ([[const]], [[enum]], [[default]]) on a
materialized node: the literal is canonicalized first, and the assertion is
checked against the canonical form. A load-time check that compares the authored
spelling against the pattern while the emitted constant carries the canonical
one can both accept an unsatisfiable schema and reject a satisfiable one.

## Property-testing matrix

### Accepted (positive)

| Shape | Example |
|---|---|
| Inclusive max | `{type:"string", maxLength:10}` |
| `.0`-valued bound | `{type:"string", maxLength:10.0}` |
| Zero max (empty string only) | `{type:"string", maxLength:0}` |
| Exact length (min==max) | `{type:"string", minLength:5, maxLength:5}` |

### Rejected at load time (negative)

| Reason | Example |
|---|---|
| Value not a number | `maxLength:"5"`, `maxLength:true`, `maxLength:null` |
| Negative value | `maxLength:-1` |
| Fractional value | `maxLength:5.5` |
| Type mismatch (P7.1) | `{type:"integer", maxLength:5}`, `{type:"array", maxLength:3}` |
| Unsatisfiable range | `{type:"string", minLength:10, maxLength:2}` |
| Literal exceeds bound | `{type:"string", maxLength:2, const:"abc"}`, `{…, default:"abc"}`, `{…, enum:["ok","toolong"]}` |

### Runtime fixtures (validator)

- `codePointCount(v) == max` → OK (`≤` is inclusive).
- `v` one code point over `max` → one `PayloadValidationError` application failure whose reason names
  the bound and count (`must have length <= 2, got 3`).
- **Astral / multi-byte fixtures (the P1 core):** `"a😀b"` counts as **3**
  in all four (not 6/4/4); `"😀😀"` counts as **2**; NFC `"é"` counts as
  **1** and NFD `"e"+U+0301` as **2** — every language agrees on each
  because none normalizes.
- Combined with other failing assertions ([[minLength]], [[pattern]], a
  failing sibling field) → **all** reported in one shot (**P11**).
- Serialize of an in-memory over-length string → rejected before emit
  (**P12**), not silently written.

## Interactions

- **[[minLength]]**: the paired lower bound over the same code-point count.
  `minLength > maxLength` is a load error; `minLength == maxLength` pins an
  **exact** length (accepted — a fixed-width string, the string analog of
  the numeric `minimum == maximum` single-value pin in [[maximum]]).
- **[[pattern]]**: an independent string assertion; both apply and both
  aggregate. We do **not** attempt cross-satisfiability between a regex and
  a length bound (a pattern *can* imply a minimum length, but reasoning
  about it is undecidable in general and out of scope — see [[pattern]]).
- **[[type]]**: gates applicability — `maxLength` is meaningful only for
  `string`; a mismatch is a load reject (**P7.1**). `maxLength` never
  narrows the emitted type and does not force it to `string`: a
  materializing sibling ([[format]] / [[contentEncoding]]) may replace it
  with a native construct while the bound still checks the encoded wire
  string.
- **[[const]] / [[default]] / [[enum]]**: a string literal supplied by one
  of these on the **same node** MUST satisfy `maxLength` at load (rule
  above) — the string-length half of the deferred literal-vs-constraint
  obligation.
- **[[minProperties]] / [[maxProperties]]**: the *object member-count*
  analog; [[maxItems]] / [[minItems]] is the *array-length* analog. All
  are count assertions that share the "count the right thing, compare
  once" shape but count different things (and the array/object counts,
  unlike string length, need no unit normalization).

## Ecosystem variance

| Source dialect | Action |
|---|---|
| JSON Schema 2020-12 | Native. |
| OpenAPI 3.1 | Adopts 2020-12 — `maxLength` identical. Native. |
| OpenAPI 3.0 / draft-4 | `maxLength` present since draft-4 with identical (code-point) semantics. Native, no rewrite. |
| Swagger 2.0 | Same as OAS 3.0. |

Note: some non-conformant toolchains implement `maxLength` as a UTF-16 or
byte count. We follow the spec (code points); a schema authored against a
UTF-16-counting tool could differ only for astral-plane input, which is
the same class of edge the `string_probe` fixtures pin down.
