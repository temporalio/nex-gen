# `uniqueItems`

Source: JSON Schema 2020-12, Validation vocabulary, §6.4.3
"Validation Keywords for Arrays → uniqueItems".

Asserts that **no two elements** of an array instance are equal under JSON
equality. A pure runtime assertion — no type impact. The third array
assertion alongside the count pair [[minItems]] / [[maxItems]]; unlike
them its cost and portability depend on the **element type**, which is why
its support envelope is drawn at the scalar/composite line rather than
being unconditional.

## Spec summary

Verbatim (2020-12 validation, §6.4.3):

> The value of this keyword MUST be a boolean.

> If this keyword has boolean value false, the instance validates
> successfully. If it has boolean value true, the instance validates
> successfully if all of its elements are unique.

> Omitting this keyword has the same behavior as a value of false.

Distilled:
- Value MUST be a **boolean**.
- `uniqueItems: true` → instance valid iff all elements are **pairwise
  distinct under JSON equality** (by type and value — the same equality
  [[const]] / [[enum]] use for membership, lifted to element-vs-element).
- `uniqueItems: false` → **no-op** (spec: same as omitting) — accepted but
  vacuous, mirroring [[minItems]] `0`.
- Applies only to array instances; a `uniqueItems` on a non-array [[type]]
  is rejected at load (**P7.1**), like the count pair.
- Pure assertion; no annotation behavior, no effect on the emitted
  collection type ([[items]]'s `[]T` / `T[]` / `list[T]` / `List<T>`).
- **The equality is where the cost lives.** For a scalar element [[type]]
  (string / number / integer / boolean) uniqueness is a cheap, trivially
  portable comparison — every target agrees value-for-value (**P1**). For
  a **composite** element (object / array) it requires **deep structural
  equality** with number normalization and key-order independence — the
  same "correct in principle, just costly" surface [[const]] / [[enum]]
  defer for composite members.

## Support decision

**Support:** yes for a **scalar element [[type]]** (string / number /
integer / boolean); **composite** element types (object / array) are
**deferred** — `uniqueItems: true` over them is a load reject with a "not
yet supported" diagnostic, exactly the stance [[const]] / [[enum]] take on
composite members (the deep structural-equality check is correct in
principle, just costly — revisit on demand).

Grounding ([[PRINCIPLES.md]]): **P10** (enforced at the boundary), **P11**
(aggregated), **P12** (a pure predicate over the decoded value in the
**shared `Validate`** layer, identical both directions — no serialize-side
adapter logic of its own). No effect on emitted types. The scalar
restriction is the **P1** line: element-vs-element equality over a scalar
type is the same value comparison [[enum]] already specifies value-for-value
across all four targets, whereas a portable composite deep-equal is extra
surface we don't yet commit to.

Loader behavior:
- Value not a boolean (`uniqueItems:"true"`, `uniqueItems:1`,
  `uniqueItems:null`) → reject.
- **`uniqueItems: false`** → accepted, treated as **omitted** (the spec's
  explicit equivalence); it constrains nothing. Not rejected as
  "redundant" — it is a spec-sanctioned identity that templated OpenAPI
  tooling emits, so honoring it as a no-op is friendlier than a diagnostic
  (mirrors [[minItems]] `0`).
- `uniqueItems` on a non-array [[type]] (`{type:"string", uniqueItems:true}`)
  → reject per **P7.1** (statically meaningless).
- `uniqueItems` present without `type:"array"` → reject per [[type]]
  (missing/mismatched type); a `type:"array"` still requires [[items]].
- **`uniqueItems: true` with a composite element [[items]]**
  (`items:{type:"object", …}` or `items:{type:"array", …}`) → **reject**
  with a "not yet supported" diagnostic (deferred; see Support decision).
  A `uniqueItems: false` over the same composite `items` is still a no-op
  and accepted — nothing is asserted, so no equality is needed.

## Type mapping

None. The emitted collection type is [[items]]'s `[]T` / `T[]` /
`list[T]` / `List<T>`; the assertion lives only in the validator.

## Validator mapping

Per **P10**/**P11**. A single **all-distinct** check. Deserialize compares
the original wire elements, including elements that fail [[items]] conversion;
serialize compares decoded elements. Every element that
repeats an earlier one is reported, naming both indexes; equality is the
same value comparison [[enum]] uses (exact `==` for numbers — see below).
Because the element [[type]] is scalar, Go, TypeScript and Java track seen
values in their native hash/set primitive; Python uses a JSON-aware equality
walk over a list (so `true` is distinct from `1`) because a generated model is a non-frozen dataclass and
therefore unhashable (see the Python row).

| Language | Strategy |
|---|---|
| Go | Deserialize normalizes each original `json.RawMessage` to a JSON value key and tracks the first raw index; serialize performs the equivalent typed-slice walk in shared `Validate`. Both collect duplicate-index violations into one `PayloadValidationError` application failure. |
| TypeScript | After the `Array.isArray` guard ([[items]]), deserialize walks the raw array with a `Map` before returning the typed result; serialize walks the typed array. `Map` uses value equality for the supported scalar elements. |
| Python | The runtime's `_check_unique_items(value, path, violations)` is called with the raw list on deserialize and the typed list on serialize. It uses a JSON-aware equality walk, **not** a `set`/`dict`, so booleans stay distinct from numbers and composite raw values compare structurally. Arrays are small and correctness beats the O(n²) (**P2**). |
| Java | The per-POJO collecting deserializer walks the original `JsonNode` array using `SpecNumbers.valueKey` for JSON numeric equality; serialize walks the typed `List<T>`. Both report the colliding indexes in the single `PayloadValidationError` application failure. Not bean-validation. |

Reason strings name the **colliding positions** (`duplicate items: element
at index 3 equals index 1`) per the count-family convention — the
aggregated error tells the caller which elements clashed, not a bare
keyword.

**Float exactness.** For a `number` element type, equality is **exact
`==`**, never an epsilon — identical to [[enum]] / [[const]]: the wire
values are IEEE-754 binary64 from correctly-rounded decimal→double
parsing, so the same decimal yields the identical bit pattern in every
target. An integer-valued number member such as `1.0` normalizes to an
integer at load (as in [[enum]]), so `[1, 1.0]` in a `number` array is a
runtime duplicate (both are the same value), not two distinct elements.
`-0.0` equals `0.0`; `NaN`/`±Infinity` cannot appear.

### Serialize-side (P12)

Identical to the count pair: the predicate **re-runs before emit** over
the decoded value, so an in-memory slice/list holding duplicates fails
serialize with the same aggregated primitive rather than being written.
Real teeth in every target: building the collection in memory is
unchecked in all four (same rationale as the [[maxItems]] bound
re-check). The element count and values are the same in memory as on the
wire, so the check is the identical all-distinct walk in both directions.

## Property-testing matrix

### Accepted (positive)

| Shape | Example |
|---|---|
| Scalar string uniqueness | `{type:"array", items:{type:string}, uniqueItems:true}` |
| Scalar integer uniqueness | `{type:"array", items:{type:integer}, uniqueItems:true}` |
| Scalar number uniqueness (exact `==`) | `{type:"array", items:{type:number}, uniqueItems:true}` |
| Boolean uniqueness (degenerate, ≤2 distinct) | `{type:"array", items:{type:boolean}, uniqueItems:true}` |
| No-op false | `{type:"array", items:{type:string}, uniqueItems:false}` |
| No-op false over composite (nothing asserted) | `{type:"array", items:{type:object, …}, uniqueItems:false}` |
| Combined with count bounds | `{type:"array", items:{type:string}, minItems:1, maxItems:10, uniqueItems:true}` |
| Nullable scalar element | `{type:"array", items:{oneOf:[{type:string},{type:"null"}]}, uniqueItems:true}` — `null` is one value; two `null`s are a duplicate |

### Rejected at load time (negative)

| Reason | Example |
|---|---|
| Value not a boolean | `uniqueItems:"true"`, `uniqueItems:1`, `uniqueItems:null` |
| Type mismatch (P7.1) | `{type:"string", uniqueItems:true}` |
| Composite element, deferred | `{type:"array", items:{type:object, …}, uniqueItems:true}`, `{type:"array", items:{type:array, …}, uniqueItems:true}` |

### Runtime fixtures (validator)

- All elements distinct → OK (both directions).
- A repeated element → one `PayloadValidationError` application failure naming the colliding indexes
  (`duplicate items: element at index 3 equals index 1`).
- Empty array `[]` and single-element array → OK (vacuously unique).
- `number` array with `[1, 1.0]` → duplicate (both the same value); with
  `[1, 2]` → OK.
- `boolean` array `[true, false]` → OK; `[true, true]` → duplicate.
- Combined with a failing count bound ([[minItems]] / [[maxItems]]) or a
  failing sibling field → **all** reported in one shot (**P11**).
- Serialize of an in-memory slice/list containing duplicates → rejected
  before emit (**P12**), not silently written.

## Interactions

- **[[minItems]] / [[maxItems]]**: independent array assertions; all apply
  and aggregate. We do **not** cross-check uniqueness against a count
  bound — deciding whether the element type admits enough distinct values
  to fill a `minItems`-with-`uniqueItems` array is out of scope, and that
  non-check is owned by [[minItems]] (parallel to the regex-vs-length
  non-check in [[maxLength]]). The degenerate `boolean` case (`minItems:3`
  + `uniqueItems:true` over ≤2 distinct values) is unsatisfiable at
  runtime but still not caught at load, keeping the rule uniform.
- **[[items]]**: gates the element type and thus applicability —
  `uniqueItems:true` is supported only when `items` is scalar; a composite
  `items` defers it. `items` types the elements, `uniqueItems` requires
  them distinct; orthogonal where both apply.
- **[[type]]**: gates applicability to `type:"array"`; a mismatch is a load
  reject (**P7.1**). The emitted collection type is unchanged.
- **[[enum]] / [[const]]**: share the **scalar value-equality** definition
  used here (exact `==` for numbers, normalized integer-valued numbers).
  An array whose `items` carries an `enum` may also set `uniqueItems`; the
  two compose — `enum` closes each element to a set, `uniqueItems` forbids
  repeats within the instance. Composite equality is deferred in all three.
- **[[required]]**: orthogonal — `required` decides whether the array
  member is present; `uniqueItems` shapes its value. A present empty `[]`
  satisfies both `required` and `uniqueItems`.
- **[[nullability]]**: if the element schema is the nullable [[nullability]]
  pattern, a `null` element is one value for uniqueness purposes — two
  `null` elements are a duplicate. Otherwise orthogonal.
