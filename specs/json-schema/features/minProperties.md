# `minProperties`

Source: JSON Schema 2020-12, Validation vocabulary, §6.5.2
"Validation Keywords for Objects → minProperties".

Sets a floor on the number of members an object instance must have. A
pure runtime count assertion — no type impact. Mirror of
[[maxProperties]].

## Spec summary

Verbatim (2020-12 validation, §6.5.2):

> The value of this keyword MUST be a non-negative integer.

> An object instance is valid against "minProperties" if its number of
> properties is greater than, or equal to, the value of this keyword.

> Omitting this keyword has the same behavior as a value of 0.

Distilled:
- Counts **all** members including preserved extras.
- Omission ≡ `0` (no floor).

## Support decision

**Support:** yes — runtime assertion.

Lowers to a boundary count check; no effect on emitted types. Citing
[[PRINCIPLES.md]]: **P10**, **P11**.

Loader behavior:
- Value not a non-negative integer (honors `1.0`-as-integer + the
  integer cap, see [[type]]) → reject.
- The portable count ceiling from [[maxItems]] applies, and so does the
  `long`-literal obligation the ceiling does not discharge: a bound in
  `[2^31, 2^53−1]` does not compile in Java unless the emitter suffixes the
  literal.
- The keyword requires `type: "object"`; a missing or different type rejects
  at load time under **P7.1**. One diagnostic covers the four object-constraint
  keywords.
- `minProperties: 0` → accepted (no-op; equals omission).
- `minProperties > maxProperties` (both present) → reject
  (unsatisfiable).
- `minProperties` greater than the number of members the schema can
  ever have — i.e. a closed object ([[additionalProperties]] `false`)
  with fewer declared [[properties]] than `minProperties` → reject
  (unsatisfiable). Diagnostic names the gap.
- **The floor is reconciled against every keyword that caps the key space**, not
  only the closed-object case above: a `minProperties` above the largest
  inhabitable key count is a load reject whatever imposes the cap. Besides
  `additionalProperties: false` with a declared member set, that is a
  [[propertyNames]] whose key language is **finite and enumerable** — an `enum`,
  or a `maxLength: 0` — which closes the key space to a countable set exactly as
  a declared member list does. A key space bounded only by a [[pattern]] is not
  required to be counted; the rule reaches the cases decidable by enumeration,
  and no others. The count keywords own this duty because the count is what
  makes the combination decidable, so the capping keyword's own spec need not
  restate it. The mirror duty for the upper bound is in [[maxProperties]].
  **Status: implemented** for both enumerable forms, including the zero-or-one
  capacity of `maxLength: 0` after its sibling key assertions are applied.

**Which object is counted, in both directions.** The count is over the **wire
object at the boundary being validated**: inbound, the raw decoded object before
default population; outbound, the object the encoder will actually write. A
member the encoder omits is not a wire key and does not count — that covers an
unset default, and in TypeScript any value the encoder drops (`undefined`, a
function, a `toJSON` returning `undefined`) or replaces (a `toJSON` returning
another object). **P12.2** names the failure mode directly: a predicate that
counts wire keys on one side and in-memory fields on the other is not
conformant, however the two sides share code.

**Optional+nullable reconciliation.** A positive `minProperties` beside an
optional nullable declared member rejects at load. An explicit `null` for that
member is a wire key inbound, but Go, Java and Python deliberately collapse it
to the same in-memory state as absence and omit it outbound; TypeScript retains
it. Accepting the combination would therefore change validation semantics,
which **P1**'s fidelity exception does not license. Make the member required or
non-nullable, or remove the floor. `minProperties: 0` is still accepted because
it asserts nothing. The check follows bare `$ref` aliases to the nullable
definition, so moving the wrapper into `$defs` does not evade the rule.

## Type mapping

None. Constraint lives only in the validator.

## Validator mapping

Per **P10**/**P11**. The "number of properties" is the count of **distinct
member keys present on the wire**, taken at the deserialize boundary
**before** default population (see [[default]]) — a default-filled key is never on
the wire and does not count (see Interactions). Count the wire object as a
single number; do **not** sum a declared-fields bucket and an extras
bucket separately (case-mapping can route a key to either, and the
declared-vs-extras split is a language-side artifact, not a wire fact). Same
per-language strategy as [[maxProperties]] with `< min` as the failing
comparison:

| Language | Strategy |
|---|---|
| Go | `UnmarshalJSON` applies the predicate to the raw wire-key count; `Validate` applies the same comparison and reason to the key set `MarshalJSON` will write. |
| TypeScript | `fromTransferType` applies the predicate to the wire object's own enumerable keys; `toTransferType` applies it to the keys the outbound conversion will actually emit. The comparison is inlined in each converter. |
| Python | `from_transfer_type` counts `len(raw)` on the raw wire dict — one number over the wire object, taken before any default is materialized — and appends `Violation(path="", reason=f"must have at least {min} properties, got {n}")` when `n < min`, into the single generated `PayloadValidationError` application failure. |
| Java | the per-POJO collecting deserializer (PRINCIPLES Java §5) counts distinct keys in the parsed tree (`< min`) — one number over the wire object, **not** POJO fields + catch-all map summed post-bind; a violation joins the single `PayloadValidationError` application failure. |

### Serialize-side (P12)

The count runs again before emit, over the keys that **will actually be
written** — *after* default omission and the omit-vs-`null` decision (the
serialize mirror of "before default population"). A field whose default
is unset is omitted and does **not** count toward the floor, exactly as
it didn't on the way in — so a model that reads as populated in memory
(defaults visible) can legitimately fall **under** `minProperties` on the
wire, and serialize fails
(`MarshalJSON`/`toTransferType`/`to_transfer_type`) rather than emitting
an under-floor object; in Python the count is `len(out)` on the dict
`to_transfer_type` has built. See [[maxProperties]] serialize note
(symmetric).

## Property-testing matrix

### Accepted (positive)

| Shape | Example |
|---|---|
| Floor satisfiable | `{type:object, additionalProperties:true, minProperties:1}` |
| Floor = 0 | `{type:object, properties:{a:{type:string}}, minProperties:0}` |

### Rejected at load time (negative)

| Reason | Example |
|---|---|
| Not non-negative integer | `minProperties:-1`, `minProperties:1.5`, `minProperties:"1"` |
| Missing/mismatched object type | `{minProperties:1}`, `{type:"array", minProperties:1}` |
| `> maxProperties` | `minProperties:5, maxProperties:2` |
| Unsatisfiable on closed object | `properties:{a:{…}}, additionalProperties:false, minProperties:2` |
| Unsatisfiable against a finite key space | `additionalProperties:true, propertyNames:{type:string, enum:["a","b"]}, minProperties:3` |
| Optional nullable member loses wire presence | `properties:{a:{oneOf:[{type:string},{type:null}]}}, minProperties:1` |

### Runtime fixtures (validator)

- Member count `== min` → OK (≥ inclusive).
- Member count `min-1` → one `PayloadValidationError` application failure whose reason names the
  floor and count (`must have at least 2 properties, got 1`).
- Open struct reaching the floor via extras → OK (extras count).

## Interactions

- **[[maxProperties]]**: paired bound over the same member set;
  `min > max` is a load error.
- **[[required]]**: required members count toward the floor but
  `minProperties` may demand *more* than the required set names —
  satisfiable only if extras are permitted ([[additionalProperties]]
  not `false`, or enough optional [[properties]]).
- **[[additionalProperties]] `false`**: caps how many members can exist;
  a `minProperties` above the declared count is then unsatisfiable
  (load error).
- **[[propertyNames]]**: composes freely with the count, and a finite key
  language (an `enum`, a `maxLength: 0`) caps the count the same way a declared
  member set does — reconciled here, per the loader-behavior rule above.
- **[[nullability]]**: a positive floor beside an optional nullable declared
  member rejects at load, preventing the three-target presence collapse from
  changing the outbound count.
- **`default`**: `default` is an annotation, not an assertion — a
  default-filled key is never on the wire, so it does **not** count
  toward the floor. The count is taken before default population
  (see [[default]]); a client sending fewer than `minProperties` keys is invalid
  regardless of server-side defaults.
- **`const`** (future feature): an object-level `const` pins the exact
  member set, making `minProperties` statically decidable — a const
  object with fewer members than `minProperties` is unsatisfiable (load
  reject), mirroring the [[additionalProperties]] `false` case.
  Property-level `const` only constrains a value *if present*, so it has
  no count impact unless paired with [[required]]. Enforcement deferred
  to the `const` spec.
