# `unevaluatedItems`

Source: JSON Schema 2020-12, Core (Unevaluated vocabulary), §11.2
"Keywords for Applying Subschemas to Arrays with Unevaluated Items →
unevaluatedItems".

The **annotation-aware** array catch-all: it constrains elements left
unevaluated after *all* array applicators in scope have run. **Not
supported** — rejected at load time per **P6** (categorical exclusion, not
a deferral).

## Spec summary

Verbatim (2020-12 core, Unevaluated vocabulary):

> The value of "unevaluatedItems" MUST be a valid JSON Schema.

> The behavior of this keyword depends on the annotation results of
> adjacent keywords that apply to the instance location being validated.
> Specifically, the annotations from "prefixItems", "items", and
> "contains", which can come from those keywords when they are adjacent to
> the "unevaluatedItems" keyword. Those three annotations, as well as
> "unevaluatedItems", can also result from any and all adjacent in-place
> applicator keywords.

> If no relevant annotations are present, the "unevaluatedItems" subschema
> MUST be applied to all locations in the array. If a boolean true value
> is present from any of the relevant annotations, "unevaluatedItems" MUST
> be ignored. Otherwise, the subschema MUST be applied to any index
> greater than the largest annotation value for "prefixItems", which does
> not appear in any annotation value for "contains".

> This means that "prefixItems", "items", "contains", and all in-place
> applicators MUST be evaluated before this keyword can be evaluated.

> The annotation result of this keyword is the boolean true if any items
> in the array were evaluated with this schema's subschema. This
> annotation affects the behavior of "unevaluatedItems" in parent schemas.

> Omitting this keyword has the same assertion behavior as an empty schema.

Distilled:
- Like the tail form of [[items]], but the set of elements it governs is
  *whatever no applicator evaluated* — computed from the **transitive**
  annotation results of [[prefixItems]], [[items]], [[contains]], and
  every in-place applicator (`allOf`, `anyOf`, `oneOf`, `if`/`then`/
  `else`, `$ref`).
- The spec is explicit that all those keywords **MUST be evaluated first**
  — this keyword is defined in terms of their annotation outputs, not the
  raw array.

## Support decision

**Support:** no — **rejected at load time (P6).**

`unevaluatedItems` has no coherent lowering in the strict subset:

- **P6 (strict subset), annotation dependency.** Like its object sibling
  [[unevaluatedProperties]], correct behavior requires a runtime
  annotation-collection pass over every array applicator before this
  schema can be applied to the remaining indices — a schema-interpreter
  runtime, not the flat (de)serializers the subset emits (**P1**/**P2**).
- **Degenerate in this subset.** [[prefixItems]], `anyOf`, `not`, and
  `if`/`then`/`else` are rejected. The admitted applicators leave no residual
  evaluated-index set to track: [[allOf]] is flattened at load, [[oneOf]] is a
  closed sum type, and a [[ref]] either names a model or folds its siblings into
  that same `allOf` merge. [[items]] already applies to **all** elements of a
  homogeneous list, and [[contains]] is a pure existential that constrains no
  positional tail. So no element is ever "unevaluated" in a way [[items]] does
  not already cover;
  `unevaluatedItems` would be either redundant with [[items]] or reach for
  the rejected [[prefixItems]] tuple tail. Rejecting it is the honest,
  unambiguous outcome (**P7**/**P7.1**).

Loader behavior:
- Any `unevaluatedItems` present → reject with a located diagnostic.
- The diagnostic points to [[items]] as the supported array element
  schema (`{type:array, items:{type:T}}` — a homogeneous list).

## Type mapping

None — rejected before any type is emitted.

## Validator mapping

None — rejected at load time, so there is no (de)serialize boundary and no
serialize-side behavior (**P12**).

## Property-testing matrix

### Rejected at load time (negative) — the whole surface

| Reason | Example |
|---|---|
| Annotation-dependent tail (P6) | `{type:array, items:{type:string}, unevaluatedItems:false}` |
| Reaches for rejected tuple tail (P6) | `{type:array, prefixItems:[{type:string}], unevaluatedItems:{type:integer}}` |
| Bare `unevaluatedItems:true` (P6) | `{type:array, unevaluatedItems:true}` |

There are no accepted or runtime fixtures: the keyword never reaches code
generation.

## Interactions

- **[[items]]**: the supported homogeneous-list applicator. In this subset
  it already governs **every** element, so there is no unevaluated tail for
  this keyword to add — use [[items]] instead.
- **[[prefixItems]]**: rejected tuple applicator; its absence is why no
  positional tail is ever left unevaluated. Its spec already cross-
  references this keyword as rejected.
- **[[contains]]**: the supported scalar existential — evaluates matching
  elements but leaves no positional tail for this keyword to govern.
- **[[unevaluatedProperties]]**: the object-side sibling, also rejected
  per **P6** for the same annotation-dependency reason.
- **[[minItems]] / [[maxItems]] / [[uniqueItems]]**: array-level
  assertions, unaffected by this keyword's rejection.

## Ecosystem variance

| Source dialect | Action |
|---|---|
| JSON Schema 2020-12 | Reject (P6). |
| OpenAPI 3.1 | `unevaluatedItems` present (3.1 adopts 2020-12) → reject. |
| OpenAPI 3.0 | No `unevaluatedItems` keyword — nothing to reject. |
| Swagger 2.0 / draft-4..7 | No `unevaluatedItems` keyword (draft-6/7 used `additionalItems` for the tuple tail — rejected with [[prefixItems]]). |
