# `maxItems`

Source: JSON Schema 2020-12, Validation vocabulary, §6.4.1
"Validation Keywords for Arrays → maxItems".

Sets an **inclusive** upper bound on the **number of elements** an array
instance may have. A pure runtime count assertion — no type impact. The
canonical spec for the array-length pair; [[minItems]] shares the
machinery documented here and differs only in the comparison operator.

## Spec summary

Verbatim (2020-12 validation, §6.4.1):

> The value of this keyword MUST be a non-negative integer.

> An array instance is valid against "maxItems" if its size is less than,
> or equal to, the value of this keyword.

Distilled:
- Value MUST be a **non-negative integer**.
- Instance valid iff `elementCount(instance) ≤ maxItems`.
- "Size" is the number of top-level array elements — unlike the
  string-length family, this is a **directly portable** count: every
  target's native length primitive (`len` / `.length` / `len` / `.size()`)
  agrees on it, so there is no code-point-style unit hazard (contrast
  [[maxLength]]).
- Applies **only** to array instances; the spec silently ignores it for
  non-arrays. Per **P7.1** we instead reject a `maxItems` on a non-array
  [[type]] at load time.
- Pure assertion; no annotation behavior.

## Support decision

**Support:** yes — runtime element-count comparison.

Lowers to a single `≤` count comparison in every language; no effect on
emitted types. Citing [[PRINCIPLES.md]]: **P10** (enforced at the
boundary), **P11** (aggregated), **P12** (a pure predicate over the
decoded value in the **shared `Validate`** layer — identical in both
directions, no parse/encode adapter logic of its own).

Loader behavior:
- Value not a non-negative integer → reject: a non-number
  (`maxItems:"3"`, `maxItems:true`, `maxItems:null`), a **negative**
  value (`maxItems:-1`), or a **fractional** value (`maxItems:3.5`).
  `maxItems:3.0` is accepted (≡ `3`, honoring the `1.0`-as-integer rule
  from [[type]]).
- `maxItems` on a non-array [[type]] (`{type:"string", maxItems:3}`) →
  reject per **P7.1** (statically meaningless — the string-length analog
  is [[maxLength]], the object member-count analog is [[maxProperties]]).
- `maxItems` present without `type:"array"` → reject per [[type]]
  (missing/mismatched type); a `type:"array"` still requires [[items]].
- **`minItems` > `maxItems` on the same node → reject (unsatisfiable).**
  `minItems == maxItems` pins an **exact** length (accepted — a
  fixed-size array). See **Interactions → satisfiability**.
- `maxItems: 0` → accepted (array must be empty). Rarely the intent — an
  always-empty array carries no data — but it is a legitimate numeric
  ceiling, not a schema bug, so it is not rejected.

## Type mapping

None. The emitted collection type is [[items]]'s `[]T` / `T[]` /
`list[T]` / `List<T>`; the bound lives only in the validator.

## Validator mapping

Per **P10**/**P11**. A single `≤` comparison of the **element count**
against the fixed bound. On deserialize it counts the original wire array
even if an element fails [[items]] conversion; on serialize it uses the
decoded collection's native length. Unlike [[maxLength]]
there is no unit subtlety, so each language uses its bare length
primitive.

| Language | Strategy |
|---|---|
| Go | `UnmarshalJSON` checks `len(rawArray) > max` after collecting indexed item violations; serialize checks the typed slice in shared `Validate`. Both collect into one `ValidationError`. |
| TypeScript | After the `Array.isArray` guard ([[items]]), deserialize checks `raw.length > max` after parsing the elements; serialize checks the typed array. A failure pushes ``Violation{path, reason: `too many items: at most ${max}, got ${raw.length}`}``. |
| Python | After the `isinstance(raw, list)` guard ([[items]]), the transfer converter checks `len(raw) > max` after parsing the elements; serialize checks the typed list. Both aggregate into the generated `ValidationError`. |
| Java | The per-POJO collecting deserializer (PRINCIPLES Java §5) checks `node.size() > max` after parsing the elements; serialize checks the typed `List<T>`. Both push a structured violation into the single `ValidationException`. Not bean-validation `@Size`. |

**Informative `reason` strings.** The `Violation` `reason` names the
**concrete bound and the offending count** — `too many items: at most 3,
got 4` — per the [[maxProperties]] count-family convention, so the
aggregated error tells the caller which ceiling was crossed and by how
much. The bound is an emitted compile-time constant; the count is
computed at runtime.

### Serialize-side (P12)

The bound is a shared-`Validate` predicate, so it **re-runs before emit**
over the decoded value — a model constructed with an over-long slice/list
in memory fails serialize with the same aggregated primitive rather than
emitting an out-of-bounds array. Real teeth in the statically-typed
targets, where in-memory construction is unchecked (identical rationale
to the [[type]] integer-cap re-check and the [[maxLength]] bound
re-check). The element count is the same in memory as on the wire (no
default-omission subtlety like [[maxProperties]] has), so the check is a
plain length comparison in both directions.

## Property-testing matrix

### Accepted (positive)

| Shape | Example |
|---|---|
| Inclusive max | `{type:"array", items:{type:string}, maxItems:10}` |
| `.0`-valued bound | `{type:"array", items:{type:string}, maxItems:10.0}` |
| Zero max (empty array only) | `{type:"array", items:{type:string}, maxItems:0}` |
| Exact size (min==max) | `{type:"array", items:{type:string}, minItems:2, maxItems:2}` |

### Rejected at load time (negative)

| Reason | Example |
|---|---|
| Value not a number | `maxItems:"3"`, `maxItems:true`, `maxItems:null` |
| Negative value | `maxItems:-1` |
| Fractional value | `maxItems:3.5` |
| Type mismatch (P7.1) | `{type:"string", maxItems:3}`, `{type:"integer", maxItems:3}` |
| Unsatisfiable range | `{type:"array", items:{type:string}, minItems:10, maxItems:2}` |

### Runtime fixtures (validator)

- Element count `== max` → OK (`≤` is inclusive).
- Element count `max+1` → one `ValidationError` whose reason names the
  bound and count (`too many items: at most 3, got 4`).
- Empty array `[]` against `maxItems:0` → OK.
- Combined with other failing assertions ([[minItems]], a failing element
  [[items]] check, a failing sibling field) → **all** reported in one
  shot (**P11**).
- Serialize of an in-memory over-long slice/list → rejected before emit
  (**P12**), not silently written.

## Interactions

- **[[minItems]]**: the paired lower bound over the same element count.
  `minItems > maxItems` is a load error; `minItems == maxItems` pins an
  **exact** size (accepted — a fixed-size array, the array analog of the
  string-length exact pin in [[maxLength]] and the numeric `minimum ==
  maximum` pin in [[maximum]]).
- **[[items]]**: `items` types the elements, `maxItems` caps how many
  there may be — orthogonal; both apply and aggregate. `maxItems` counts
  elements regardless of whether each satisfies `items`.
- **[[type]]**: gates applicability — `maxItems` is meaningful only for
  `type:"array"`; a mismatch is a load reject (**P7.1**). The emitted
  collection type is unchanged; `maxItems` never narrows it.
- **[[uniqueItems]]**: an independent array assertion; both apply and
  aggregate. We do **not** attempt cross-satisfiability between a
  uniqueness constraint and a count bound (deciding whether enough
  distinct values exist to fill a `minItems`-with-`uniqueItems` array is
  out of scope — see [[minItems]]).
- **[[required]]**: orthogonal — `required` decides whether the array
  member is present; `maxItems` bounds its size. A present empty `[]`
  satisfies `required` regardless of `maxItems`.
- **`const`/`default`** (composite, deferred): the current subset has
  scalar `const`/`default` only ([[const]], [[default]]). When an
  array-valued literal lands, its element count MUST satisfy `maxItems`
  at load — the array-length half of the literal-vs-constraint obligation
  (mirroring the [[maxLength]] string-literal check). Enforcement
  deferred to that feature.
