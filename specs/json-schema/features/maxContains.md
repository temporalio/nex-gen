# `maxContains`

Source: JSON Schema 2020-12, Validation vocabulary, §6.4.4
"Validation Keywords for Arrays → maxContains".

Sets an **inclusive** upper bound on the **number of elements that match
the [[contains]] matcher**. A pure runtime count assertion — no type
impact. The canonical spec for the *contains-count* pair: [[minContains]]
shares the match-counting machinery documented here and differs only in the
comparison operator (and in the special `0` case it owns). Where
[[maxItems]] caps the **total** element count, `maxContains` caps only the
**matching** subset — it is meaningless without a [[contains]] on the same
node.

## Spec summary

Verbatim (2020-12 validation, §6.4.4):

> The value of this keyword MUST be a non-negative integer.

> If "contains" is not present within the same schema object, then this
> keyword has no effect.

> An instance array is valid against "maxContains" in two ways, depending
> on the form of the value of "contains". In the first form, if the value
> of "maxContains" is greater than or equal to the number of elements which
> validate against the "contains" subschema, then the array is valid. In
> the second form, if the value of "maxContains" is less than the number of
> elements which validate against the "contains" subschema, then the array
> is invalid.

Distilled:
- Value MUST be a **non-negative integer**.
- Instance valid iff `matchCount(instance) ≤ maxContains`, where
  `matchCount` is the number of elements validating against the
  [[contains]] matcher (the same predicate [[contains]] defines).
- **No effect without [[contains]].** Per **P7.1** we do not silently
  ignore it: a `maxContains` with no sibling `contains` is a load reject
  (below), not a no-op.
- Pure assertion; no annotation behavior, no effect on the emitted
  collection type ([[items]]'s `[]T` / `T[]` / `list[T]` / `List<T>`).

## Support decision

**Support:** yes — a runtime **match-count** comparison over the
[[contains]] matcher, on the same scalar-only envelope [[contains]] draws
(scalar matcher over a scalar [[items]] element type; composite matchers /
elements are deferred there and therefore here too).

Lowers to a single `≤` count comparison after tallying matches; no effect
on emitted types. Citing [[PRINCIPLES.md]]: **P10** (enforced at the
boundary), **P11** (aggregated), **P12** — one comparison over one kind of
operand, the match tally over the array's complete element sequence, applied at
both boundaries with the same reason.

Loader behavior:
- Value not a non-negative integer → reject: a non-number
  (`maxContains:"3"`, `maxContains:true`, `maxContains:null`), a
  **negative** value (`maxContains:-1`), or a **fractional** value
  (`maxContains:2.5`). `maxContains:2.0` is accepted (≡ `2`, honoring the
  `1.0`-as-integer rule from [[type]]).
- The portable count ceiling from [[maxItems]], and the emitted-literal
  obligation that comes with a bound above 2^31−1, apply here unchanged.
- **`maxContains` without [[contains]]** on the same node → **reject**
  (**P7.1**, statically meaningless — the spec's "no effect" tightened to a
  loud error). Diagnostic: add a `contains` matcher or remove `maxContains`.
- `maxContains` on a non-array [[type]] → reject per **P7.1** (it can only
  co-occur with `contains`, which itself requires `type:"array"` + [[items]]
  — see [[contains]]).
- **`minContains` > `maxContains` on the same node → reject
  (unsatisfiable).** `minContains == maxContains` pins an **exact** match
  count (accepted — "exactly N elements match"). All combined
  satisfiability for the pair lives here — see **Interactions →
  satisfiability**.
- **`maxContains:0`** → "**no** element may match the matcher" (a *must-not-
  contain* assertion). Legitimate, but only satisfiable together with
  **`minContains:0`**: the [[contains]] default is `minContains:1`, so a
  bare `maxContains:0` is `min 1 > max 0` → **reject** as unsatisfiable. With
  `minContains:0` present it is accepted (see [[minContains]] and the
  fixtures below).

## Type mapping

None. The emitted collection type is [[items]]'s `[]T` / `T[]` /
`list[T]` / `List<T>`; the bound lives only in the validator.

## Validator mapping

Per **P10**/**P11**. A single `≤` comparison of the **match count** against
the fixed bound. Deserialize tallies every original wire element; serialize
tallies the decoded collection. The same matcher predicate, comparison, and
reason apply in both directions (**P12**).

| Language | Strategy |
|---|---|
| Go | `UnmarshalJSON` tallies the original `json.RawMessage` elements; shared `Validate` tallies the typed slice before serialize. Both push the same bound/count violation. |
| TypeScript | The transfer converters tally the raw array inbound and the typed array outbound after the `Array.isArray` guard. `max` is an emitted numeric constant. |
| Python | `_check_contains` receives the raw list inbound and the typed list outbound, appending the same bound/count violation. |
| Java | The collecting deserializer tallies the original Jackson array node; serialize tallies the typed `List<T>`. Not bean-validation. |

**Informative `reason` strings.** The `reason` names the **concrete bound
and the offending match count** — `too many matching items: at most 2, got
3` — per the [[maxItems]] count-family convention, distinct from
[[maxItems]]' *total*-count message so the caller can tell a match-count
violation from a size violation. The bound is an emitted compile-time
constant; the count is computed at runtime.

### Serialize-side (P12)

Identical to [[maxItems]]: the predicate **re-runs before emit** over the
decoded value — a model constructed in memory whose elements yield too many
matches fails serialize with the same aggregated primitive rather than
being written. Real teeth in the statically-typed targets (Go/TS/Java),
where in-memory construction is unchecked. Both directions tally over the
array's complete element sequence — the wire array inbound, the decoded
collection outbound — so the tally-and-compare is the identical predicate in
both directions.

## Property-testing matrix

### Accepted (positive)

| Shape | Example |
|---|---|
| Inclusive match cap | `{type:"array", items:{type:integer}, contains:{minimum:5}, maxContains:3}` |
| `.0`-valued bound | `{type:"array", items:{type:string}, contains:{const:"x"}, maxContains:2.0}` |
| Exact match count (min==max) | `{type:"array", items:{type:string}, contains:{const:"x"}, minContains:2, maxContains:2}` |
| Range 0..max (must-not-exceed, zero OK) | `{type:"array", items:{type:string}, contains:{const:"x"}, minContains:0, maxContains:2}` |
| Must-not-contain (exactly zero matches) | `{type:"array", items:{type:string}, contains:{const:"x"}, minContains:0, maxContains:0}` |

### Rejected at load time (negative)

| Reason | Example |
|---|---|
| Value not a number | `maxContains:"3"`, `maxContains:true`, `maxContains:null` |
| Negative value | `maxContains:-1` |
| Fractional value | `maxContains:2.5` |
| Above the portable count ceiling | `maxContains:9007199254740992` |
| No sibling `contains` (P7.1) | `{type:"array", items:{type:string}, maxContains:2}` |
| Unsatisfiable range | `{type:"array", items:{type:string}, contains:{const:"x"}, minContains:3, maxContains:1}` |
| `maxContains:0` at the default `minContains:1` (unsatisfiable) | `{type:"array", items:{type:string}, contains:{const:"x"}, maxContains:0}` |

### Runtime fixtures (validator)

- Match count `== max` → OK (`≤` is inclusive).
- Match count `max+1` → one `PayloadValidationError` application failure naming the bound and count
  (`too many matching items: at most 2, got 3`).
- Non-matching elements never count — an array full of non-matching
  elements has match count `0`, trivially `≤ max`.
- `minContains:0, maxContains:0` (must-not-contain): an array with **no**
  matching element → OK; **one** matching element → fail
  (`too many matching items: at most 0, got 1`).
- Combined with a failing sibling ([[minContains]], [[minItems]] /
  [[maxItems]], a bad element per [[items]]) → **all** reported in one shot
  (**P11**).
- Serialize of an in-memory value with too many matches → rejected before
  emit (**P12**), not silently written.

## Interactions

- **[[contains]]**: the gate — `maxContains` is meaningless without it and
  is a load reject on its own. It reuses [[contains]]' matcher predicate and
  its scalar-only support envelope and its full match tally. `contains` alone
  is the spec-default `minContains:1` with no ceiling.
- **[[minContains]] — satisfiability (canonical, owned here)**: the paired
  lower bound over the same match count. `minContains > maxContains` is a
  load error; `minContains == maxContains` pins an **exact** match count
  (accepted). Because the [[contains]] default is `minContains:1`, a
  `maxContains:0` is unsatisfiable unless `minContains:0` is set. We do
  **not** cross-check a `minContains`/`maxContains` bound against how many
  elements *could* match the matcher (undecidable in general — parallel to
  the uniqueness-vs-count non-check in [[minItems]]).
- **[[minItems]] / [[maxItems]]**: bound the **total** element count;
  `maxContains` bounds the **matching** subset. Independent — all apply and
  aggregate. We do not collapse them (a `maxContains:0` does not imply any
  `maxItems`).
- **[[items]]**: types (and constrains) every element; `maxContains` caps
  how many of them additionally match the [[contains]] matcher. Supported
  only when `items` is scalar (via [[contains]]).
- **[[type]]**: gates applicability to `type:"array"` (through
  [[contains]]); a mismatch is a load reject (**P7.1**). The emitted
  collection type is unchanged.
- **[[uniqueItems]] / [[required]] / [[nullability]]**: orthogonal, exactly
  as for [[contains]] — uniqueness of elements, presence of the member, and
  null of the member are all independent of the match-count ceiling.
