# `deprecated`

Source: JSON Schema 2020-12, Validation, §9.3 "A Vocabulary for Basic
Meta-Data Annotations → deprecated".

Marks the schema location — a type, member, service, or operation — as
**discouraged for continued use**: still valid on the wire, but callers
should migrate away. In the spec it is a **pure annotation** — it never
affects validation. **Supported** — it lowers into each target's
**native deprecation marker** (Go's `// Deprecated:` godoc paragraph, a
TS JSDoc `@deprecated` tag, a Java `@Deprecated` annotation, a Python
PEP 702 `@deprecated(…, category=None)` marker), so editors, compilers,
and type checkers surface the marker as far as that native mechanism
reaches. Two of those reaches are genuinely limited: TypeScript's JSDoc
deprecation is a language-service signal rather than a `tsc` diagnostic,
and PEP 702 defines no field form. That is a limit of the mechanism, not a
licence for a marker the generator has placed where its tool cannot see
it — Go's `// Deprecated:` is only live as its own godoc paragraph, so
emitting it without the preceding blank `//` line is a generator defect,
not a toolchain limit. The marker has no validation, serialization, or
access-warning effect. It is a **tag** in the doc-comment assembly
[[description]] owns; because `deprecated` is boolean-only it carries no
message of its own, so the human rationale comes from the sibling
[[description]].

## Spec summary

Verbatim (2020-12 validation, §9.3):

> The value of this keyword MUST be a boolean.

> When multiple occurrences of this keyword are applicable to a single
> sub-instance, applications SHOULD consider the instance location to be
> deprecated if any occurrence specifies a true value.

> If "deprecated" has a value of boolean true, it indicates that
> applications SHOULD refrain from usage of the declared property. It MAY
> mean the property is going to be removed in the future.

> A root schema containing "deprecated" with a value of true indicates
> that the entire resource being described MAY be removed in the future.

Distilled:
- Value **MUST be a boolean**; default `false`.
- Multiple applicable occurrences **OR together**: **any** `true` ⇒ the
  location is deprecated. This is *not* the last-wins merge that
  [[description]] / [[title]] / [[default]] use (see Loader behavior).
- An **annotation**, not an assertion: per spec it **never changes
  whether an instance validates**. A wire value is judged by the schema's
  assertions alone, `deprecated` present or not.
- Applies to **any subschema** — a `$defs` type, a property subschema —
  and, on the Nexus envelope, to **services and operations** (see
  [[services]]). A root-schema `deprecated: true` deprecates the whole
  generated type.

## Support decision

**Support:** yes — as a **native deprecation marker** (plus a doc-comment
tag) on the declaration it decorates. It emits no validator and no
adapter behavior.

The defining choices (citing [[PRINCIPLES.md]]):
- **Idiomatic native markers (P2).** Unlike [[examples]] — the other
  metadata annotation that is merely *ignored* — `deprecated` maps to a
  **first-class deprecation mechanism in every target**: godoc's
  `Deprecated:` convention, JSDoc `@deprecated`, `java.lang.Deprecated`,
  PEP 702 `@deprecated`. Emitting the native marker is what makes the
  generated code read like code a human wrote, and it makes the
  deprecation *actionable* wherever the target tooling can carry it — and
  where the generator controls the placement, it must produce the form the tool
  recognizes rather than one it ignores.
  TypeScript exposes JSDoc deprecation through language services rather than a
  `tsc` diagnostic; Python's PEP 702 signal applies to decorated types and
  callables, while its field/operation `Annotated` form is documentation-only.
  So we emit, not ignore.
- **No modeling problem to block it.** [[readOnly]] / [[writeOnly]]
  reject because their directional intent has no single-type lowering;
  `deprecated` has no such fork — it merely *marks* a location and leaves
  the type, its fields, and the wire shape unchanged. Every target has an
  **authored** declaration to attach the marker to: the type or the member
  the keyword was written on. It never propagates to a *synthesized*
  declaration — a per-member closed-value type, a union-branch wrapper —
  because the author did not declare those, so a marker on them is
  gratuitous and would make the marker count target-dependent.
- **Annotation, no runtime effect (P10/P12/P1).** `deprecated`
  contributes **no** constraint predicate to the shared `Validate` and
  **no** parse/encode adapter logic. A deprecated value is accepted and
  round-trips exactly like a non-deprecated one. Its entire effect is at
  generation time, in the emitted declaration — with no runtime validation,
  serialization, or access-warning effect in any target.
  Python is held to the same bar: it uses PEP 702's `category=None` so
  even its `@deprecated` marker raises no access-time `DeprecationWarning`
  (see Type mapping); we deliberately do **not** emit the runtime
  `Field(deprecated=True)` form, keeping the four targets in parity (P1).
- **Never an identifier (P13/P1/P15).** `deprecated` never names a type,
  field, service, or operation. On an ordinary declaration it therefore
  synthesizes nothing and adds nothing to the per-scope collision pass.
  Beside a `$ref` it must stay that way too: the marker belongs on the
  **member** bound to the reference, so the reference survives and no
  clone, and no new identifier, is created (see Loader behavior).

Loader behavior:
- `deprecated` value **not a boolean** → **reject** (P7.1; the spec's own
  MUST). Diagnostic names the offending value: `deprecated must be a
  boolean, got "true"` for `{deprecated: "true"}`, likewise `{deprecated:
  1}`.
- `deprecated: false` → **accepted and ignored** — it is the explicit
  form of the default (not deprecated), so no marker is emitted and no
  diagnostic is raised. This is the [[examples]] ergonomic exception to
  P7.1: `deprecated: false` is pervasive in OpenAPI / imported schemas as
  an explicit "not deprecated" flag, and it is unambiguous and inert, so
  rejecting it would force authors to strip meaningful, harmless metadata
  just to generate. (Contrast [[readOnly]] / [[writeOnly]], whose `false`
  rejects — but those keywords are rejected wholesale regardless.)
- `deprecated` as a **sibling of `$ref`**, **of either value**, leaves the
  reference intact — the keyword is never a merge conjunct, because it
  deprecates the *member* and asserts nothing about the referenced value. The
  OR is applied at the **use site**: the member keeps the referenced type and
  the marker lands on the member, which is what the Type-mapping table below
  says and what all four targets can express (a Go struct-field doc comment, a
  TS property JSDoc tag, a Python `Annotated`, a Java getter annotation). The
  sibling must **not** trigger the implicit-`allOf` fold ([[ref]], [[allOf]]):
  a fold would clone the target into a use-site type, move the marker off the
  member the author annotated, and — for `deprecated: false`, which means
  exactly what omitting the keyword means — change a member's type with no
  marker and no diagnostic to explain it.
- `deprecated` on a [[nullability]] `null` branch → **reject**, of either
  value: a `null` branch must be exactly `{type: "null"}` with no siblings, an
  invariant [[nullability]] owns and this keyword does not override. To mark a
  **nullable member**, write `deprecated` on the wrapper beside the `oneOf`;
  on the **non-null branch** it is an inline subschema with no declaration and
  is therefore dropped, so the two spellings are not interchangeable.
- `deprecated` at a **document root** — a definitions-only root or a Nexus
  envelope root — is **accepted**: `true` deprecates the generated root type
  where there is one, and is otherwise dropped like any marker with no
  declaration to attach to. It never makes a root "model-shaped": an imported
  document routinely carries a document-level annotation, and a reject there
  would have to describe a model the author never wrote.
- Multiple `deprecated` occurrences applicable to one node — the branches
  of an explicit [[allOf]] merge (P6), or a `$ref` sibling ORed against the
  resolved target's own value — → **OR**: if **any** applicable occurrence
  is `true`, the location is deprecated. This differs from [[description]] / [[title]] /
  [[default]], which resolve last-wins; `deprecated` follows the spec's
  own any-true-wins rule (§9.3). A merged `false` occurrence is ignored
  (as in isolation), so it never suppresses a sibling `true` — the
  location is deprecated iff some applicable occurrence is `true`.
- **Orthogonal** to [[required]], [[default]], [[const]], and
  [[nullability]]: a deprecated member may still be required, carry a
  default, and be nullable. `deprecated` changes none of those; it only
  adds the marker.

## Type mapping

**None.** `deprecated` does not change the emitted type and contributes
no identifier. Its sole materialization is the **native deprecation
marker** (and a doc-comment tag) on the declaration generated for the
schema location it was written on:

| Placement | What gets marked |
|---|---|
| `$defs` type | the generated **type** (Go `type` / TS `interface` / Python class / Java class) |
| property subschema | the generated **field / getter / member** |
| service (envelope) | the generated **service interface**; see [[services]] |
| operation (envelope) | the generated **operation method**; see [[services]] |
| inline subschema with no declaration | dropped — nowhere to attach a marker. This is the rule for every such position: an [[items]] element, a typed-map value, a [[contains]] matcher, a [[propertyNames]] key subschema, and the non-null branch of a degenerate nullability `oneOf`. None of them rejects; all of them drop. |

Per-language marker (the meat — a native construct, not just comment
text):

| Language | Native marker | Effect for consumers |
|---|---|---|
| Go | a `// Deprecated: This <kind> is deprecated.` paragraph in the doc comment — **its own paragraph**, preceded by a blank `//` line, at every declaration kind (godoc convention; generic reason — see below) | `staticcheck` SA1019 flags every use and `go doc` renders it, but **only** because the marker opens a paragraph: the analyzer splits the comment on blank lines and requires a part to *begin* `Deprecated: `. A doc-comment tag, not a keyword. |
| TypeScript | a bare JSDoc `@deprecated` tag in the `/** … */` block | Editors and language services strike through or suggest at call sites; `tsc` emits no deprecation diagnostic. |
| Python | PEP 702 `@deprecated("…", category=None)` (`typing_extensions` backport) on a generated type/service; fields and operation attributes use `Annotated[T, deprecated("…", category=None)]` as documentation metadata | Type/service decorators are recognized by PEP 702-aware checkers. Field and operation attribute metadata is not a PEP 702 warning construct. `category=None` suppresses access-time `DeprecationWarning`. |
| Java | the `@Deprecated` annotation on the type / getter / method, paired with a Javadoc `@deprecated This <kind> is deprecated.` tag | `javac` warns at every use; IDEs strike-through; `javadoc` renders the tag text in the "Deprecated." block and `deprecated-list.html`. |

The marker attaches to a declaration that already exists; no new identifier
is synthesized for it, in any position — including beside a `$ref`, where the
reference survives and the marker lands on the member (see Loader behavior).
So `deprecated` contributes nothing to the per-scope collision pass (P15).

## Doc-comment tag and the message limitation

`deprecated` is the **tag** slot (assembly part 3) of the doc comment
[[description]] owns — summary line ([[title]]) → body ([[description]])
→ **tags**. It renders as a trailer in the doc comment *and*, where the
target has one, the native marker (annotation / decorator / godoc
paragraph). The shared placement, wrapping, and escaping rules are those
[[description]] specifies; this keyword only fills the tag slot.

`deprecated` is **boolean-only** — the spec gives it no message string —
and the sibling [[description]] is **never copied** into the marker's
message slot: the rationale, replacement pointer, or removal timeline is
prose that lives in the doc-comment body ([[description]]) directly above
the marker, and copying it in would repeat the same text twice in the
generated source.

The marker is emitted **bare** only where the native construct carries no
text slot at all — a JSDoc `@deprecated` tag (TS). The other three targets
have a text slot that their tooling renders, so they carry a **generic**
reason, `This <kind> is deprecated.` — where `<kind>` ∈ type / field /
service / operation, already known from the placement:
- **Java** — the `@Deprecated` annotation paired with
  `@deprecated This <kind> is deprecated.`; `javadoc` renders the tag text
  into the type's "Deprecated." block and into `deprecated-list.html`, and a
  bare tag renders an empty explanation there.
- **Go** — the godoc convention is a `// Deprecated: <text>` paragraph; a
  bare `Deprecated:` reads incomplete, so the generic reason fills it:
  `// Deprecated: This field is deprecated.`
- **Python** — PEP 702 `deprecated(msg, category=None)` takes a
  **mandatory** message argument, so both forms carry the generic
  string: `@deprecated("This type is deprecated.", category=None)` on a
  declaration, `Annotated[T, deprecated("This field is deprecated.",
  category=None)]` on a field. (`category=None` is what keeps the marker
  static-only — see Type mapping.)

The rationale the author actually wrote still travels with the symbol, in
the doc-comment body, for every target — adjacent to the marker in Go,
TypeScript and Java, and *below* it in Python, whose decorator necessarily
precedes the docstring it documents.

## Validator mapping

`deprecated` emits **no validator** and **no adapter behavior**. It is an
annotation (§9.3): it never appears in the shared `Validate`, never runs
in the parse or encode adapter, and never causes a runtime pass/fail in
either direction (**P12**). A deprecated value deserializes, validates,
and re-serializes identically to a non-deprecated one.

There is no runtime validation, serialization, or access-warning effect in any
target. Python emits `category=None`, which suppresses access-time
`DeprecationWarning`; Python also retains `__deprecated__`, and Java's
`@Deprecated` is runtime-visible metadata. Generated code does not inspect
either artifact.

## Property-testing matrix

### Accepted (positive)

| Shape | Handling |
|---|---|
| Deprecated `$defs` type | `{deprecated:true, type:"object", …}` → marker on the generated type |
| Deprecated property | `properties:{legacyId:{deprecated:true, type:"string"}}` → marker on the field/getter |
| Deprecated + description | `{deprecated:true, description:"Use `uuid` instead."}` → body carries the rationale, tag/marker below it |
| Deprecated + required | `required:["legacyId"]` with `legacyId:{deprecated:true, …}` → still required; marker added (orthogonal) |
| Deprecated + default | `{deprecated:true, type:"string", default:"x"}` → default machinery unchanged; marker added |
| Merged occurrences OR to true | `allOf:[{deprecated:true},{…}]` → deprecated (any true wins; see [[allOf]]) |
| `deprecated: false` (explicit not-deprecated) | `{deprecated:false, type:"string"}` → accepted, no marker, no diagnostic |
| Deprecated service / operation | envelope `services.ChatService.operations.legacyCall.deprecated` → marker on the generated method (see [[services]]) |
| Sibling of a `$ref` (either value) | `{$ref:"#/$defs/User", deprecated:true}` → member keeps type `User`, marker on the member; `deprecated:false` leaves the member byte-identical to omitting it |
| At a document root | a definitions-only or Nexus envelope root carrying `deprecated` → accepted; marks the root type if there is one, else dropped |
| Member with a closed value set | `{type:"string", enum:["a","b"], deprecated:true}` → one marker, on the member; the synthesized closed-value type is left unmarked |

### Rejected at load time (negative)

| Reason | Example |
|---|---|
| Value not a boolean | `{deprecated:"true"}`, `{deprecated:1}`, `{deprecated:null}` |
| On a nullability `null` branch (either value) | `{oneOf:[{type:"string"},{type:"null", deprecated:false}]}` (see [[nullability]]) |

### Runtime fixtures

None. `deprecated` has no runtime behavior — it neither validates nor
(de)serializes. Its only observable output is the generated declaration
(marker + doc tag), covered by generation-snapshot tests. The Python
snapshot asserts the `category=None` form, which is a text assertion: proving
that accessing a deprecated symbol raises no `DeprecationWarning` needs a
runtime assertion that executes the access.

## Interactions

- **[[description]]**: owns the doc-comment assembly `deprecated` plugs
  into as a **tag**, and supplies the rationale prose the bare marker
  lacks (the boolean carries no message). The tag renders directly below
  the `description` body.
- **[[title]]**: the summary line of the same doc comment; unaffected by
  `deprecated`.
- **[[properties]]**: `deprecated` decorates a **member**, never renames
  it — the field name still comes from the resolved naming policy. The
  marker attaches to the generated field/getter.
- **[[services]]**: the Nexus envelope can mark a service or operation
  `deprecated`; the marker lands on the generated interface / method.
- **[[allOf]]** / **[[ref]]**: an explicit `allOf` can bring multiple
  `deprecated` occurrences onto one node; they **OR** (any true ⇒
  deprecated), unlike the last-wins annotations. As a `$ref` **sibling** the
  keyword does not merge at all — the reference stays a reference and the OR
  is applied at the use site (see Loader behavior).
- **[[required]]**, **[[default]]**, **[[const]]**, **[[nullability]]**:
  fully orthogonal — a deprecated member keeps its presence, default,
  fixed value, and nullability; only the marker is added.
- **[[examples]]** / **[[readOnly]]** / **[[writeOnly]]**: the sibling
  metadata annotations. `deprecated` is the **supported** one — it lowers
  cleanly to a native marker, where [[examples]] is ignored (inert) and
  [[readOnly]] / [[writeOnly]] reject (directional).

## Ecosystem variance

| Source dialect | Action |
|---|---|
| JSON Schema 2020-12 | Native annotation (§9.3, added in 2019-09) → native deprecation marker. |
| OpenAPI 3.1 | Adopts 2020-12 — `deprecated` native on schemas → marker. OpenAPI's own `deprecated` on operations/parameters carries the same intent. |
| OpenAPI 3.0 | Has `deprecated` (boolean) on schemas, operations, and parameters, same intent → marker. |
| draft-07 | **No `deprecated` keyword** (introduced in 2019-09); a draft-07 source simply has nothing to lower. |

`deprecated` is a boolean with a single, consistent intent across every
dialect that has it, so no rewrite is needed — only the per-language
marker choice above.
