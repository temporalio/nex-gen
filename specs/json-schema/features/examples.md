# `examples`

Source: JSON Schema 2020-12, Validation, §9.5 "A Vocabulary for Basic
Meta-Data Annotations → examples".

Carries an **array of sample instance values** illustrating a schema. In
2020-12 it is a **pure annotation** — it never affects validation.
**Accepted and ignored at load (inert)** — dropped with no effect on the
emitted type, validator, or wire, pending a future doc-comment rendering
feature. Unlike [[readOnly]] / [[writeOnly]] (whose directional intent
makes them a modeling problem that ignoring would silently violate),
`examples` is fully inert: dropping it yields correct code, missing only
an optional doc rendering. So rather than reject it — which would force
authors to strip ubiquitous, harmless metadata just to generate — the
generator accepts and ignores it. This is a deliberate, narrowly-scoped
exception to the **P7.1** loud-reject stance, safe precisely because the
keyword touches neither the type nor the wire.

## Spec summary

Verbatim (2020-12 validation, §9.5):

> The value of this keyword MUST be an array. There are no restrictions
> placed on the values within the array.

> When multiple occurrences of this keyword are applicable to a single
> sub-instance, implementations MUST provide a flat array of all values
> rather than an array of arrays.

> This keyword can be used to provide sample JSON values associated with
> a particular schema, for the purpose of illustrating usage. It is
> RECOMMENDED that these values be valid against the associated schema.

Distilled:
- Value **MUST be an array**; its elements are arbitrary JSON values
  (any type, no restriction).
- An **annotation**, not an assertion: it **never changes whether an
  instance validates**.
- The values *should* be valid against the schema (a RECOMMENDATION we
  would strengthen to a load-time MUST when supported — see Open
  questions).
- Purely illustrative — sample values for documentation, the sibling of
  [[description]] / [[title]] / [[default]] in the basic-metadata
  vocabulary.

## Support decision

**Support:** not yet — **accepted and ignored at load (inert)**, pending
the deferred doc-comment feature.

- **It has a clear future home: the doc comment (P2).** As a pure
  annotation `examples` can only ever materialize in the generated **doc
  comment** — it never affects the emitted type, an identifier, or
  validation. That is the same landing site [[description]] and [[title]]
  use, via the shared doc-comment assembly machinery [[description]] owns.
  So this is a *deferral of a supportable feature*, categorically unlike
  the non-lowerable [[readOnly]] / [[writeOnly]] / [[contentSchema]]
  rejects.
- **Ignored, because it is inert (the P7.1 exception).** P7.1 rejects
  loudly what is *ambiguous* or would produce *silently-wrong* output;
  `examples` is neither — it has zero effect on the emitted type or the
  wire, so ignoring it yields fully correct code, lacking only an optional
  doc rendering. It is also **pervasive** in real-world and imported
  schemas (every OpenAPI example carries it), so rejecting each occurrence
  would force authors to strip harmless documentation just to generate.
  The safe, ergonomic choice is to accept and drop it. (Contrast
  [[readOnly]] / [[writeOnly]], also annotations but carrying a
  *directional intent* that ignoring would silently violate — hence those
  reject, this one does not.)
- **Not free like a string annotation, when supported.** `examples` is
  *structured data* (an array of arbitrary JSON values), so — unlike
  [[description]]'s verbatim prose — a rendering feature must **serialize
  each value to a stable literal**, place it in a per-language example
  slot, and enforce validity at load. Those are real design decisions
  (Open questions), so the feature is scoped out of the current subset;
  until it lands the keyword is ignored rather than half-implemented.

Loader behavior:
- Any `examples` present → **accepted and ignored** — dropped with no
  effect on the emitted type, validator, or wire, and **no diagnostic**.
- Its value shape (the spec's MUST-be-array) is **not enforced while
  ignored**: the keyword is dropped wholesale, so a malformed `examples`
  is inert rather than a load error. The array-MUST and per-value
  validity return when the doc-comment feature lands (Open questions).
- An `examples` value is **opaque instance data**, never schema. No pass
  may interpret anything inside it: a `$ref`-shaped object among the sample
  values is a sample value, not a reference edge, and must not enter the
  `$ref` closure, pull a file into the input set, raise the input root, or
  change one module, package or file name ([[ref]],
  [[generated-file-layout]]). This is what "inert" has to mean for a
  keyword whose value is arbitrary JSON, and it is the precondition for the
  P7.1 accept-and-ignore exception above: the keyword may not affect the
  emitted type, any identifier, or the wire.
- `examples` as a **sibling of `$ref`** leaves the reference intact: it is
  dropped **before** the loader decides whether the reference needs an
  implicit merge, so it can neither clone the target into a use-site type
  nor add a P15 identifier ([[ref]], [[allOf]] state the same rule from the
  merge side).
- `examples` on a [[nullability]] `null` branch → **reject**: a `null`
  branch must be exactly `{type: "null"}` with no siblings, an invariant
  [[nullability]] owns and an inert annotation does not override. At a
  **document root** — definitions-only or Nexus envelope — `examples` is
  accepted and dropped, as [[description]] is there.

## Type mapping

None — ignored, so no type is emitted. When supported it will contribute
**no** type and **no** identifier (a doc-comment annotation only).

## Validator mapping

None — an annotation (§9.5); it will never appear in the shared
`Validate` or run in either adapter (**P12**). Its entire future effect
is at generation time, in the emitted doc comment.

## Property-testing matrix

### Accepted (ignored)

| Shape | Handling |
|---|---|
| `examples` array on any node | `{type:"string", examples:["alice","bob"]}` → accepted, dropped, no output |
| Malformed `examples` value | `{examples:"alice"}`, `{examples:{a:1}}` → also ignored (array-MUST not enforced while ignored) |
| A sample value shaped like a reference | `{type:"object", examples:[{"$ref":"../other/victim.yaml"}]}` → the object is data; the input set, the input root and every emitted module name are byte-identical to the same schema without it |
| Sibling of a `$ref` | `{$ref:"#/$defs/User", examples:[{…}]}` → dropped, reference unchanged |
| At a document root | a definitions-only or Nexus envelope root carrying `examples` → dropped |

### Rejected at load time (negative)

| Reason | Example |
|---|---|
| On a nullability `null` branch | `{oneOf:[{type:"string"},{type:"null", examples:["x"]}]}` (see [[nullability]]) |

There are no runtime fixtures: the keyword is inert at runtime — it
produces no output while ignored. What does need a barrier is the inertness
itself: a structural regression that generates otherwise-identical schemas
with and without `examples` — including a sample value containing a
`$ref`-shaped object, and an `examples` beside a `$ref` — and compares the
whole emitted file map.

## Interactions

- **[[description]]**: owns the doc-comment assembly, wrapping, and
  escaping machinery `examples` will plug into (as a rendered
  tag/trailer) once supported.
- **[[title]]**: the other doc-comment annotation; `examples` would join
  the same summary → body → tags assembly.
- **[[default]]**: the spec permits a `default` to double as an example;
  and `default` is the precedent for the
  strengthen-RECOMMENDED-validity-to-a-MUST stance `examples` would adopt
  when supported.
- **[[const]] / [[enum]]**: supplied value sets whose members a supported
  `examples` would be validated against at load (same cross-cutting
  literal-validity obligation).
- **[[ref]]** / **[[generated-file-layout]]**: an `examples` value is data,
  so it contributes no closure edge, no input file, and no change to the
  input root — which is what keeps module, package and file names a
  function of the schema rather than of its documentation.

## Ecosystem variance

| Source dialect | Action |
|---|---|
| JSON Schema 2020-12 | Annotation (§9.5), an **array** → ignored (inert). |
| OpenAPI 3.1 | Adopts 2020-12 `examples` (array) → ignored. Note OAS also has a *singular* `example` (a single value) that is **not** a JSON Schema keyword — it falls under the generator's unknown-keyword handling, not this rule. |
| OpenAPI 3.0 | Singular `example` only; no array `examples` at the schema level. |
| draft-07 | `examples` present since draft-06 (array) → ignored. |

## Open questions

1. **Doc-comment rendering (the deferred design).** When supported,
   `examples` renders into the generated doc comment via [[description]]'s
   machinery, using each language's native slot where one exists — JSDoc
   `@example` (TS), an `Examples:` section in the attribute docstring for a
   field / in the class docstring for a type (Python), a rendered
   `Example:` line (Go godoc, Java Javadoc `{@code …}`). Each array value
   is serialized to a canonical JSON literal; multiple values → multiple
   tags/lines; merged occurrences flatten per the spec's flat-array rule.
2. **Validity as a load-time MUST.** Following [[default]], each example
   would be required to validate against the schema at load (P7.1),
   sharing the deferred constraint-validation obligation those specs
   carry. Note the **ignore → render+validate** transition is a behavior
   change (P13): schemas that pass today with a malformed or invalid
   `examples` would then reject, so the feature should land with that
   migration in mind.
