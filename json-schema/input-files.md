# Input files (cross-cutting design note)

Not a JSON Schema keyword. Specifies the **document-level** concerns of a
generator input file: what a single input file *is*, the two file modes
the loader recognizes, and the root-property rules
(`nexusrpc` / `$schema`) that are decided **before** any schema
processing. Like [[generated-file-layout]] and [[pipeline]], this is a
loader-level note, not a per-keyword spec, so it adapts the
`features/<keyword>.md` skeleton rather than following it verbatim.

The reference semantics that turn a *set* of these files into one package
live in [[ref]] (input set / closure) and [[generated-file-layout]]
(module computation); this doc owns only the *single-file* document
concerns those build on.

## Two file modes

Every input file is interpreted in exactly one of two modes, decided
**before** any schema processing, by the presence of a root `nexusrpc`
property:

- **Nexus document** — the root carries `nexusrpc: "<version>"`. This is
  the *only* thing that enables the [[services]] extension keyword. In
  this mode the document root is a **document envelope** — its recognized
  members are `nexusrpc`, `services`, `$defs`, and optionally `$schema` /
  `description`. It is **not itself a type** and emits **no file-root
  type**. Any schema-shaped root keyword (`type`, `properties`,
  `additionalProperties`, …) → **load reject** with a fix-it ("move the
  type into `$defs`").
- **Pure JSON Schema** — no `nexusrpc` property. The file is an ordinary
  type schema exactly as the rest of these specs describe: its root **is
  a type**, named from the file basename ([[ref]] type-name derivation).
  `services` is **not** a recognized keyword in this mode.
  - **Definitions-only exception.** If the root carries **only** `$defs`
    (optionally alongside `description` / `$schema`) and **no** other
    keyword, it is a definitions bucket, not a type: the root is the
    trivial true-schema (validates anything), so emitting a file-root
    type would mean a meaningless `any`-typed top-level type named from
    the basename. In this case the generator emits **no file-root type**
    — the file contributes only its `$defs` types, exactly as a Nexus
    document's envelope contributes only its `$defs`. The moment **any**
    schema-shaped keyword (`type`, `properties`, `allOf`, `enum`, `$ref`,
    …) appears at the root, the root is a real type again and is emitted.

The mode is a property of the file, not of the run: a single generator
input set may mix Nexus documents and pure JSON Schema files freely. Both
modes contribute types to the one output package ([[generated-file-layout]]),
and a Nexus document's `$defs` are ordinary types reachable by `$ref`
from any file in the closure ([[ref]]).

## Root properties

| Root property | Mode | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| `nexusrpc` | selects mode | **Presence selects Nexus-document mode and is required to enable `services`.** Accepts **exactly** the string `"1.0.0"`. Any other value — a different version (`"1.1.0"`, `"2.0.0"`, `"0.9.0"`), a malformed string (`"1.0"`, `"v1"`), or a non-string (`1`, `1.0`) → reject (P13 — see below). |
| `$schema` | both | **Optional.** If present, must be exactly `"https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema"` (P5). Absent → 2020-12 assumed. Any other dialect URI → reject. Applies in **both** modes (a Nexus document's `$defs` are 2020-12 too). |
| `$id` | both | **Rejected anywhere** (root or nested) — refs resolve by file path + JSON pointer, with no URI re-basing. Owned by [[ref]]. |
| `$vocabulary` | both | **Rejected anywhere.** A meta-schema-only keyword (it declares which vocabularies a *dialect* requires); it has no meaning in an instance-validating type schema, and the dialect here is fixed to 2020-12 (`$schema`). Presence → reject with a fix-it ("remove `$vocabulary`; the dialect is pinned to 2020-12"). |
| `description` | both | Optional; the document/type doc comment, per the usual annotation handling. |

### `nexusrpc` — the version marker

The `nexusrpc` version property is what lets the extension format evolve
without breaking older consumers (P13). The acceptance rule is an
**exact-match pin**: the only accepted value is the literal string
`"1.0.0"`. Anything else — a different version string, a malformed string,
or a non-string — rejects loudly rather than being coerced or
range-matched.

This deliberately makes **no backward-compatibility promise** across
versions. The generator does *not* treat the marker as SemVer and does
*not* accept a range: a future `nexusrpc` release reserves the right to
break compatibility freely, so a `"1.0.0"` generator must refuse any other
declared version rather than guess that it can still read the document.
The exact pin is what makes that safe — a newer document declaring
`"1.1.0"` or `"2.0.0"` is rejected with a clear fix-it ("this generator
supports `nexusrpc` `\"1.0.0\"`; document declares …") instead of being
silently mis-read against the wrong rules. Each future generator hard-pins
the exact version(s) it actually implements; widening is an explicit,
per-release decision, never an assumed range.

### `$schema` — the dialect

The generator's strict subset is built on JSON Schema 2020-12 (P5). A
present `$schema` must name exactly that dialect; an absent `$schema` is
**assumed** to be 2020-12 (the overwhelming-common case for these files).
Any other dialect URI — draft-07 (`.../draft-07/schema#`), draft-04, an
OpenAPI dialect — rejects with a fix-it naming the required URI, rather
than the generator silently applying 2020-12 semantics to a document
authored against a different draft. This rule is the document-level home
of the dialect decision; any standalone `$schema` keyword spec **defers
to this doc**, and any standalone `$id` keyword spec **defers to [[ref]]**
(the reject is owned there) — neither restates the rule.

The companion meta keyword **`$vocabulary`** is owned here too: it belongs
only to a *meta-schema* (a schema declaring which vocabularies its dialect
requires), never to an instance-validating type schema, and the dialect is
pinned to 2020-12 regardless. It is therefore **rejected anywhere** it
appears (row above) rather than parsed — there is no custom-dialect surface
for it to configure (P5/P6).

## Stray `services` guard (P7.1)

A top-level `services` key in a file with **no** `nexusrpc` property is
almost always a forgotten version marker, so it is **rejected with a
fix-it** ("add `nexusrpc: \"1.0.0\"` to enable Nexus service
generation") rather than silently ignored. This is the only place
pure-JSON-Schema mode inspects `services`. The same loud-reject stance
([[PRINCIPLES.md]] P7.1) that catches a misspelled keyword anywhere else
catches a Nexus document missing its opt-in here.

## Relationship to the input set and module layout

A single input file is one node in the larger picture; the document-level
rules above are step one of the loader (Parse), before `$ref` resolution
and the strict-subset gate (see [[pipeline]]).

- The **input set** — the transitive closure of local `$ref`s reachable
  from the entry file(s) — and the **input root** (their common-ancestor
  directory) are computed by [[ref]] after the per-file mode is known.
- Each reachable file (Nexus document or pure JSON Schema) becomes one
  per-input **module**, named from its path relative to the input root
  ([[generated-file-layout]] module-name encoding). A Nexus document
  contributes its `$defs` types and its `services` bindings to that
  module; a pure JSON Schema file contributes its root type and `$defs`
  (or, for a definitions-only file, its `$defs` alone — see the
  definitions-only exception above).
- All types and identifiers from every file — across both modes — enter
  the single per-package namespace and the P15 collision pass (P14/P15,
  [[generated-file-layout]]).

This doc does **not** duplicate the closure or module-name algorithms;
see those specs for the detail.

## Property-testing matrix

### Accepted (positive)

| Case | Shape |
|---|---|
| Pure JSON Schema, no marker | a file with `type`/`properties` and no `nexusrpc` → root is a type |
| Pure JSON Schema, explicit dialect | as above + `$schema: ".../2020-12/schema"` |
| Definitions-only pure file | only `$defs` (+ optional `description` / `$schema`), no `nexusrpc` → no file-root type, contributes `$defs` types only |
| Nexus document opt-in | root `nexusrpc: "1.0.0"` + `services` (+ optional `$schema` 2020-12, `description`) |
| Nexus document with `$defs` only | `nexusrpc: "1.0.0"` + `$defs`, no `services` (valid envelope) |
| Dialect assumed when absent | no `$schema` → 2020-12 assumed in either mode |
| Mixed input set | a Nexus document and a pure JSON Schema file in the same closure |

### Rejected at load time (negative)

| Reason | Example |
|---|---|
| `services` without `nexusrpc` (P7.1) | top-level `services` + no `nexusrpc` → fix-it "add `nexusrpc: \"1.0.0\"`" |
| `nexusrpc` not exactly `"1.0.0"` | `nexusrpc: "1.1.0"` / `"2.0.0"` / `"0.9.0"` → fix-it naming the required `"1.0.0"` |
| Malformed/non-string `nexusrpc` | `nexusrpc: 1` / `1.0` / `"1.0"` / `"v1"` |
| Wrong `$schema` dialect | `$schema: ".../draft-07/schema#"` → fix-it naming the 2020-12 URI |
| Schema-shaped root in a Nexus document | root `type`/`properties`/`additionalProperties` alongside `nexusrpc` → "move the type into `$defs`" |
| `$id` present (anywhere) | root or nested `$id` — owned by [[ref]] |
| `$vocabulary` present | root `$vocabulary` — meta-schema-only keyword, no place in a type schema (P5/P6) |

## Interactions

- **[[services]]** — recognized **only** in a Nexus document; this doc
  owns the `nexusrpc` opt-in, the envelope rule, and the stray-`services`
  guard that gate it. The services spec keeps only
  service/operation-specific content.
- **[[ref]]** — owns the `$id` reject and the input-set/closure +
  type-name derivation that build on the per-file mode decided here.
- **[[generated-file-layout]]** — owns the per-input module computation
  and the one-package collision pass that every file (both modes) feeds.
- **[[pipeline]]** — the loader stage where these document-level checks
  run (Parse), ahead of `$ref` resolution and the strict-subset gate.
