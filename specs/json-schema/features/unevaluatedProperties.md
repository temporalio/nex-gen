# `unevaluatedProperties`

Source: JSON Schema 2020-12, Core (Unevaluated vocabulary), §11.3
"Keywords for Applying Subschemas to Objects with Unevaluated Properties →
unevaluatedProperties".

The **annotation-aware** object catch-all: it constrains members left
unevaluated after *all* applicators in scope have run. **Not supported** —
rejected at load time per **P6** (categorical exclusion, not a deferral).

## Spec summary

Verbatim (2020-12 core, Unevaluated vocabulary):

> The value of "unevaluatedProperties" MUST be a valid JSON Schema.

> The behavior of this keyword depends on the annotation results of
> adjacent keywords that apply to the instance location being validated.
> Specifically, the annotations from "properties", "patternProperties",
> and "additionalProperties", which can come from those keywords when they
> are adjacent to the "unevaluatedProperties" keyword. Those three
> annotations, as well as "unevaluatedProperties", can also result from
> any and all adjacent in-place applicator keywords. This includes but is
> not limited to the in-place applicators defined in this document.

> Validation with "unevaluatedProperties" applies only to the child values
> of instance names that do not appear in the "properties",
> "patternProperties", "additionalProperties", or "unevaluatedProperties"
> annotation results that apply to the instance location being validated.

> For all such properties, validation succeeds if the child instance
> validates against the "unevaluatedProperties" schema.

> The annotation result of this keyword is the set of instance property
> names validated by this keyword's subschema. This annotation affects the
> behavior of "unevaluatedProperties" in parent schemas.

> Omitting this keyword has the same assertion behavior as an empty schema.

Distilled:
- Like [[additionalProperties]], but the set of members it governs is
  *whatever no applicator evaluated* — the difference of the instance's
  member set and the **transitive** evaluated-name annotation gathered
  across `properties`, `patternProperties`, `additionalProperties`, **and
  every in-place applicator** (`allOf`, `anyOf`, `oneOf`, `if`/`then`/
  `else`, `$ref`, nested `unevaluatedProperties`).
- Its meaning at a location cannot be computed without first fully
  evaluating those siblings and collecting their annotation results — it
  is defined *in terms of* other keywords' outputs, not the raw instance.

## Support decision

**Support:** no — **rejected at load time (P6).**

`unevaluatedProperties` has no coherent lowering in the strict subset:

- **P6 (strict subset), annotation dependency.** Correct behavior
  requires a runtime **annotation-collection pass** — evaluate every
  in-place applicator, union the property names each one marked evaluated,
  then apply this schema to the remainder. That is a schema-interpreter
  runtime, the opposite of the flat, hand-written-feeling (de)serializers
  the subset emits (**P1**/**P2**). There is no static struct shape that
  captures "the members no branch happened to touch."
- **Redundant or incoherent in this subset — never in between.** The
  in-place applicators that would make it *differ* from
  [[additionalProperties]] either leave **no unevaluated residue** or are
  **rejected**. `anyOf`, `not`, `if`/`then`/`else`, [[patternProperties]],
  and [[prefixItems]] are rejected. The two admitted applicators do not
  reintroduce the problem: [[allOf]] is **flattened to a single schema at
  load** (its branches' `properties` are merged in, so nothing survives as
  an in-place sibling), and [[oneOf]] is a **closed sum type** whose object
  branches are complete, discriminated types (no shared residual object
  shape at the location). With no residual in-place applicator, the
  transitive evaluated set collapses to exactly [[properties]]'s matched
  names, so `unevaluatedProperties` would mean *precisely* what
  [[additionalProperties]] already means. Supporting it would add a second
  spelling of one behavior (violating the one-canonical-spelling stance the
  subset takes elsewhere) while its only *distinct* uses depend on rejected
  keywords. Rejecting it is the honest, unambiguous outcome
  (**P7**/**P7.1**).

Loader behavior:
- Any `unevaluatedProperties` present → reject with a located diagnostic.
- The diagnostic points to [[additionalProperties]] as the supported
  object catch-all: `false` for a closed struct, `true`/`{type:T}` for an
  open or typed one.

## Type mapping

None — rejected before any type is emitted.

## Validator mapping

None — rejected at load time, so there is no (de)serialize boundary and no
serialize-side behavior (**P12**).

## Property-testing matrix

### Rejected at load time (negative) — the whole surface

| Reason | Example |
|---|---|
| Annotation-dependent catch-all (P6) | `{type:object, properties:{id:{type:integer}}, unevaluatedProperties:false}` |
| Typed unevaluated schema (P6) | `{type:object, properties:{id:{type:integer}}, unevaluatedProperties:{type:string}}` |
| Bare `unevaluatedProperties:true` (P6) | `{type:object, unevaluatedProperties:true}` |

There are no accepted or runtime fixtures: the keyword never reaches code
generation.

## Interactions

- **[[additionalProperties]]**: the supported subset of this behavior. It
  looks only at the *local* [[properties]]/[[patternProperties]] matched
  names, which is statically knowable and lowers to a named catch-all
  member; `unevaluatedProperties` reaches across applicators and does not.
  The [[additionalProperties]] spec already records this keyword as
  rejected.
- **[[properties]]**: in this subset the transitive evaluated set is just
  its matched names, which is why `unevaluatedProperties` collapses to
  [[additionalProperties]] here.
- **[[patternProperties]]** / **[[prefixItems]]**: rejected applicators
  whose absence removes the only cases where `unevaluatedProperties` would
  differ from [[additionalProperties]].
- **[[unevaluatedItems]]**: the array-side sibling, also rejected per
  **P6** for the same annotation-dependency reason.

## Ecosystem variance

| Source dialect | Action |
|---|---|
| JSON Schema 2020-12 | Reject (P6). |
| OpenAPI 3.1 | `unevaluatedProperties` present (3.1 adopts 2020-12) → reject. |
| OpenAPI 3.0 | No `unevaluatedProperties` keyword — nothing to reject. |
| Swagger 2.0 / draft-4..7 | No `unevaluatedProperties` keyword — nothing to reject. |
