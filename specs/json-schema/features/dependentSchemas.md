# `dependentSchemas`

Source: JSON Schema 2020-12, Core (Applicator vocabulary), §10.2.2.4
"Keywords for Applying Subschemas Conditionally → dependentSchemas".

Conditional *subschema* application: when a trigger member is present, the
**whole object** must additionally validate against an associated
subschema. **Not supported** — rejected at load time per **P6**
(categorical exclusion, not a deferral).

## Spec summary

Verbatim (2020-12 core, Applicator):

> This keyword specifies subschemas that are evaluated if the instance is
> an object and contains a certain property.

> This keyword's value MUST be an object. Each value in the object MUST be
> a valid JSON Schema.

> If the object key is a property in the instance, the entire instance must
> validate against the subschema. Its use is dependent on the presence of
> the property.

> Omitting this keyword has the same behavior as an empty object.

Distilled:
- `{"a": <subschema>}` means: **if property `a` is present, the whole
  object must also validate against `<subschema>`.** If `a` is absent, no
  constraint.
- It applies a *subschema*, not a name list — it is exactly
  `if {required:["a"]} then <subschema>`, i.e. runtime **conditional
  shape**.
- Contrast [[dependentRequired]], which names dependent members only and
  never applies a subschema.

## Support decision

**Support:** no — **rejected at load time (P6).**

`dependentSchemas` branches the object's shape on a runtime condition,
which has no coherent lowering across the four targets:

- **P6 (strict subset), conditional shape.** The set of members and their
  types depends on whether a trigger key is present at runtime. Modeling
  that faithfully needs conditional-shape machinery — the same reason
  [[if-then-else]], [[anyOf]], and [[not]] are rejected. (Contrast
  [[allOf]], an *unconditional* intersection that flattens to one schema at
  load, and [[oneOf]], a *closed* sum type with a decidable selector — both
  supported because neither has a runtime-conditional shape, which this
  keyword does.) Go and Java
  have no way to express "this object has these extra required
  fields/constraints *only when* key `a` was supplied" as a single static
  type; the only lowerings are to forfeit typing or to synthesize
  conditional variants that do not round-trip identically across languages
  (**P1**).
- **P7 / P7.1 (reject ambiguity loudly).** A schema whose shape forks on
  instance content is exactly the kind of construct rejected at generator
  time rather than approximated.

[[dependentRequired]] is the supported subset of conditional object logic:
it tests only *name presence* (never branching on subschema validation), so
it lowers to a flat cross-field boundary check. `dependentSchemas` crosses
the line [[dependentRequired]] stays behind.

Loader behavior:
- Any `dependentSchemas` present → reject with a located diagnostic.
- An authored empty `dependentSchemas: {}` is rejected too, as a dead keyword;
  it constrains nothing, so the actionable remedy is to remove it rather than
  either alternative below.
- The diagnostic offers the coherent alternatives:
  1. **[[dependentRequired]]** — when the dependent subschema only makes
     other members *required* (`{"a": {required:["b"]}}` → `{"a":["b"]}`).
  2. **Unconditional [[properties]] + [[required]]** — when the fields are
     really always part of the shape.

## Type mapping

None — rejected before any type is emitted.

## Validator mapping

None — rejected at load time, so there is no (de)serialize boundary and no
serialize-side behavior (**P12**).

## Property-testing matrix

### Rejected at load time (negative) — the whole surface

| Reason | Example |
|---|---|
| Conditional shape (P6) | `{type:object, properties:{a:{…}}, dependentSchemas:{a:{properties:{b:{type:string}}}}}` |
| Conditional required via subschema (P6) | `{type:object, properties:{a:{…},b:{…}}, dependentSchemas:{a:{required:["b"]}}}` (use [[dependentRequired]]) |

There are no accepted or runtime fixtures: the keyword never reaches code
generation.

## Interactions

- **[[dependentRequired]]**: the supported subset — name-presence
  dependency only, no subschema application. Its spec already records
  `dependentSchemas` as rejected. A `dependentSchemas` value that is purely
  `{required:[…]}` should be rewritten to [[dependentRequired]].
- **[[required]]** / **[[properties]]**: the unconditional counterparts —
  the coherent lowering when the dependent fields are always part of the
  shape.
- **[[unevaluatedProperties]]**: the other rejected conditional/
  annotation-driven object keyword.

## Ecosystem variance

| Source dialect | Action |
|---|---|
| JSON Schema 2020-12 | Reject (P6). |
| OpenAPI 3.1 | `dependentSchemas` present (3.1 adopts 2020-12) → reject. |
| OpenAPI 3.0 / Swagger 2.0 | No `dependentSchemas` keyword — nothing to reject. |
| draft-4..7 | The merged `dependencies` keyword is rejected in both forms. Rewrite an array form as [[dependentRequired]]; the schema form has no supported lowering. |
