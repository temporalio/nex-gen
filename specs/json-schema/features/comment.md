# `$comment`

Source: JSON Schema 2020-12, Core vocabulary, §8.3 "Comments With
`$comment`".

A note left in the schema **for the schema's own maintainers** — the spec
reserves it strictly for authors and forbids implementations from acting
on it. It looks like a sibling of [[description]], but its role is the
opposite: `description` is the one annotation that **becomes** generated
documentation, whereas `$comment` is defined to **leave no trace** in
validation, in the emitted type, or in the generated source. This spec's
job is to pin that difference down: `$comment` is **accepted and
silently dropped**, not rejected and not surfaced.

## Spec summary

Verbatim (2020-12 core, §8.3):

> This keyword reserves a location for comments from schema authors to
> readers or maintainers of the schema.

> The value of this keyword MUST be a string. Implementations MUST NOT
> present this string to end users. […] Implementations MUST NOT take any
> other effect based on the presence, absence, or contents of `$comment`
> properties.

Distilled:
- The value **MUST be a string** (the spec's own MUST).
- It is **not an annotation in the collected-annotation sense**: unlike
  [[title]] / [[description]], the spec explicitly forbids presenting it
  to end users or letting it change any behavior. It is inert by mandate.
- It may appear on **any subschema** — a `$defs` type, a property
  subschema, an `items` subschema, the document root.

## Support decision

**Support:** yes — **accepted and ignored** (silently dropped at load).

This is deliberately *not* a reject. `$comment` is a known core keyword
whose spec-mandated behavior is precisely "do nothing," so honouring it
means dropping it, not refusing the schema:

- **No runtime effect (P10/P12).** `$comment` contributes **no** predicate
  to the shared `Validate` and **no** parse/encode adapter logic. A wire
  value is judged by the schema's assertions alone.
- **No type, no identifier (P13/P15/P1).** It never names or shapes a
  type, field, service, or operation, and adds nothing to the P15
  collision surface.
- **Not a doc comment (P2).** This is the line that separates it from
  [[description]]: the spec forbids presenting `$comment` to end users, so
  it is **not** routed into the generated doc comment. A maintainer note
  that says "TODO: tighten this once the API stabilises" must not leak
  into a published Go/TS/Python/Java doc block. Authors who want prose in
  the generated output use [[description]]; `$comment` stays in the source
  schema only.

Loader behavior:
- `$comment` value **not a string** → **reject** (P7.1; and the spec's own
  MUST). `{$comment: 42}`, `{$comment: {...}}`.
- `$comment` a **string** (any content, including empty) → **accepted and
  dropped**. Unlike an empty [[description]] — which is rejected because
  it renders a dead doc body — an empty `$comment` produces no output at
  all, so there is nothing degenerate to guard against.
- `$comment` as a **sibling of `$ref`** remains inert: it is dropped before
  deciding whether the reference needs an implicit merge, so adding a comment
  cannot clone the target into a new type or add a P15 identifier.
  *(Status: unimplemented — the fold gate admits only the four `x-<lang>-name`
  keywords, so today a `$comment` sibling does trigger the fold; see [[allOf]].)*
- `$comment` on a [[nullability]] `null` branch → **reject**. This is the one
  position the "any subschema" rule above does not reach: a `null` branch must
  be exactly `{type: "null"}` with no siblings, an invariant [[nullability]]
  owns and an inert annotation does not override.
- `$comment` on a **document root** — a definitions-only root or a Nexus
  envelope root — → **accepted and dropped**, exactly as [[description]] is
  there. A root-level maintainer note is what an imported OpenAPI document
  carries, and dropping it changes nothing; a reject at that position would
  have to describe a model the author never wrote.

## Type mapping

**None.** `$comment` changes neither the emitted type nor any identifier,
and — by mandate — never the generated doc comment.

## Validator mapping

`$comment` emits **no validator** and **no adapter behavior**. It never
appears in the shared `Validate`, never runs in the parse or encode
adapter, and produces no output in either direction (**P12**). Its entire
lifetime ends at load, when it is dropped.

## Property-testing matrix

### Accepted (positive)

| Shape | Example |
|---|---|
| Comment on a `$defs` type | `{$comment:"internal: revisit bounds", type:"object", …}` → dropped, type unchanged |
| Comment on a property | `properties:{age:{$comment:"was int32 in v1", type:"integer"}}` → dropped |
| Empty comment | `{$comment:"", type:"string"}` → accepted, dropped (no dead output) |
| Comment sibling of a `$ref` | `{$ref:"#/$defs/User", $comment:"use-site note"}` → comment dropped, reference unchanged ([[ref]]) |
| Comment at a document root | a definitions-only or Nexus envelope root carrying `$comment` → dropped |

### Rejected at load time (negative)

| Reason | Example |
|---|---|
| Non-string value | `{$comment:42}`, `{$comment:{...}}`, `{$comment:["x"]}`, `{$comment:null}` |
| On a nullability `null` branch | `{oneOf:[{type:"string"},{type:"null", $comment:"note"}]}` (see [[nullability]]) |

### Runtime fixtures

None. `$comment` has no runtime behavior and no generated output. A structural
generation regression should compare otherwise-identical schemas with and
without the annotation, including beside a `$ref`.

## Interactions

- **[[description]]** / **[[title]]**: the annotations that *do* surface.
  `$comment` is the deliberate opposite — same "note on a schema" shape,
  but the spec forbids presenting it, so it is dropped rather than
  rendered. Prose meant for the generated output belongs in
  [[description]].
- **[[ref]]**: a `$comment` sibling is dropped without triggering the
  implicit-`allOf` rewrite; the reference and its emitted identity stay
  unchanged.

## Ecosystem variance

| Source dialect | Action |
|---|---|
| JSON Schema 2020-12 | Native core keyword (§8.3). Accepted, dropped. |
| OpenAPI 3.1 | Adopts 2020-12 — `$comment` recognised; dropped. |
| OpenAPI 3.0 / Swagger 2.0 | No `$comment` keyword — nothing to handle. |
| draft-7 | `$comment` present since draft-7 with identical "ignore" semantics → dropped. |

## See also

- [[description]] — the annotation `$comment` is most often confused with;
  it *becomes* the doc comment, whereas `$comment` is dropped.
- [[title]] — the summary-line annotation; also surfaced, unlike
  `$comment`.
- [[ref]] — a `$comment` sibling of a `$ref` is dropped and leaves the
  reference intact.
- [[PRINCIPLES.md]] — **P2** (readable generated source), **P10/P12** (no
  runtime effect), **P13/P15/P1** (never an identifier).
