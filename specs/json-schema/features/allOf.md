# `allOf`

Source: JSON Schema 2020-12, Core (Applicator vocabulary), §10.2.1.1
"Keywords for Applying Subschemas With Boolean Logic → allOf".

The **intersection / schema-composition** keyword: an instance is valid
iff it validates against **every** subschema. Unlike the other
boolean-logic applicators ([[oneOf]], [[anyOf]], [[not]], [[if-then-else]]),
`allOf` describes constraints that all apply to **one value of one kind** —
so it is not a runtime fork at all. The generator admits it as a
**load-time merge**: the branches are flattened into a **single
materialized schema** that is then lowered by the ordinary keyword specs,
exactly as if the author had hand-written the combined schema. There is no
retained `allOf` construct past the loader, no runtime "check all branches"
loop, and no new emitted type — `allOf` is a normalization step, invisible
downstream. It earns its place (against **P6**'s example rejection of the
applicators) precisely because intersection *collapses to a single type*;
where two branches cannot be collapsed (disjoint kinds, contradictory
constraints), the merge is **rejected loudly** (**P7.1**), never
approximated.

## Spec summary

Verbatim (2020-12 core, Applicator, §10.2.1.1):

> This keyword's value MUST be a non-empty array. Each item of the array
> MUST be a valid JSON Schema.

> An instance validates successfully against this keyword if it validates
> successfully against all schemas defined by this keyword's value.

Distilled:
- The value is a non-empty array of subschemas — the **branches** — and
  the instance must satisfy **all** of them. Intersection, not choice:
  the constraints *accumulate* onto the same value.
- Because every branch constrains the same value, the conjunction is
  itself expressible as one schema whenever the branches are *compatible*.
  Merging `{minimum: 3}` and `{minimum: 4}` yields `{minimum: 4}`; merging
  `{type: string}` and `{type: number}` yields nothing satisfiable. The
  generator computes that merge at load and works only with the result.
- This is the keyword the numeric specs already anticipated: same-axis
  bounds on a *single* node are rejected as redundant ([[maximum]],
  [[minimum]]), but the same pair arriving from *different* `allOf`
  branches is legitimate and must be **tightened**, not rejected.

## Support decision

**Support:** yes, as a **load-time merge** that materializes a single
schema. The generator accepts an `allOf` iff its branches are **mergeable**
into one coherent, satisfiable schema; it rejects an `allOf` whose branches
contradict or cannot be represented as a single type.

Concretely, `allOf` is a **rewrite that runs before the per-keyword
loaders**. Its own logic is narrow:

1. **Flatten** — recursively inline nested `allOf`, resolve `$ref`
   branches (below), and drop identity branches (`true`/`{}`).
2. **Merge** — fold the branches key-by-key using the per-keyword rules
   in *Merge algorithm* below: same-axis constraints **tighten**,
   value sets **intersect**, object/array subschemas **merge recursively**.
3. **Hand back** — feed the merged schema to the ordinary loader. Every
   satisfiability, shape, and naming check is **delegated** to the keyword
   spec that owns the surviving keyword: an empty numeric interval is
   [[maximum]]'s reject, `minLength > maxLength` is [[minLength]]'s, a
   synthesized-name collision is **P15**. `allOf` does not re-implement
   them — it only produces the schema they judge.

So the merge step owns exactly two decisions the downstream loaders can't
make on their own: **tightening** a same-axis pair that legitimately came
from two branches, and **rejecting the unmergeable** — a pair with no
single-schema representation. Everything else falls out of the normal
pipeline.

Grounding ([[PRINCIPLES.md]]): **P1** — a merged single schema round-trips
identically across all four targets because there is no combinator left to
represent per-language; **P6** — this is the coherent-representation bar
the applicator rejection sets: intersection *can* be represented as one
type, so it is admitted as a merge, whereas [[oneOf]]'s sibling
applicators (`anyOf` inclusive-or, `not` negation, `if` runtime fork)
cannot collapse and stay rejected; **P7.1** — an unmergeable pair errors at
load with a fix-it, never a silent approximation; **P2** — the output is
whatever the merged schema lowers to, i.e. ordinary hand-written-feeling
types, with no `allOf` residue.

### `$ref` branches and the implicit-`allOf` sugar

A branch may be a `$ref` to a named typed definition ([[ref]]). The merge
**resolves the ref and folds the target's schema in** — the referenced
type's constraints are copied into the merged result. This is the classic
"extend a base type" composition (`allOf: [{$ref: Base}, {extra}]`).

The 2020-12 **`$ref`-with-siblings** form is *the same operation spelled as
sugar*: `{$ref: X, minLength: 3}` is an implicit `allOf` of the referenced
schema and the sibling keywords. Because `allOf` now merges, the sugar is
**merged identically** — the loader rewrites `{$ref: X, …siblings}` to
`allOf: [{$ref: X}, {…siblings}]` and folds it. The explicit and implicit
spellings behave the same; there is no spelling that a user can write which
the other spelling would reject. (This supersedes [[ref]]'s former
sibling-reject rule, which existed only because `allOf` was rejected.)

**Keywords sibling to `allOf` fold in the same way** — the `$ref` case is
just its most common instance. A node may carry keywords *alongside* its
`allOf`: `{allOf: [A, B], type: "object", description: "D"}`. Per JSON
Schema every keyword in a node applies conjunctively, so those siblings
are one more conjunct — the node is equivalent to
`allOf: [A, B, {…siblings}]`, with the node's **own** keywords folded as
the **final** branch. `$ref`, `allOf`, and plain siblings compose into one
canonical fold: `{$ref: R, allOf: [A], …S}` → `allOf: [{$ref: R}, A, {…S}]`.
The node's own keywords go **last** for a reason — under the metadata
**last-wins** rule (below) the local declaration then overrides any
[[title]]/[[description]]/[[default]] pulled in from a branch or a `$ref`
target, which is the intuitive "use-site wins" precedence. Constraints are
unaffected by the position (intersection is order-independent).

Ref-branch specifics:
- Resolution reuses [[ref]] entirely: named-targets-only, local-file-only,
  no `$id`, no HTTP. An unresolvable branch is [[ref]]'s reject.
- A `$ref` **cycle** reached through `allOf` (a type that merges itself,
  directly or transitively) is **unsatisfiable** — the flatten would not
  terminate — and is rejected reusing [[ref]]'s unsatisfiable-cycle reject.
- **The merge flattens; it does not subtype.** The base type's fields are
  *copied into* the merged type; the result is **not** a subtype of the
  base, and no inheritance/embedding is emitted (the subset has no
  inheritance). The base type still exists as its own generated type; the
  merged type is an independent, standalone type that happens to share
  field shapes. Editing the base regenerates the merged type's copied
  fields — an additive base change stays additive (**P13**).

## Merge algorithm

The merge folds branches pairwise. **Constraint** merging is associative
and order-independent (intersection is commutative), so the *validation
semantics* never depend on branch order. The one order-sensitive part is
**metadata-annotation selection** ([[title]], [[description]],
[[default]]): these carry no validation effect, so instead of rejecting a
conflict the merge keeps the **last** branch's value (**last-wins**) — a
deterministic override, not an ambiguity. The `$ref`-with-siblings rewrite
places the `$ref` **first** and the use-site siblings **last** (see
[[ref]]), so an annotation written next to a `$ref` overrides the
referenced target's. Per keyword:

### Type and value sets

| Keyword | Merge rule | Reject when |
|---|---|---|
| `type` | intersection of the declared kinds; `integer ⊂ number` (so `integer ∩ number = integer`); an absent `type` contributes no constraint | the kinds are **disjoint** (`string ∩ number`, `object ∩ array`) → unsatisfiable |
| `const` | all branch `const`s must be **deep-equal**; the shared value survives; it is then checked (decidably, at load) against every other merged keyword — kind, `enum` membership, numeric range, length | two branches carry **different** `const`s, or the `const` violates another merged constraint |
| `enum` | **set intersection** of the members (kept in first-seen order) | the intersection is **empty** |
| `const` + `enum` | the `const` must be a member of the `enum`; result is the `const` | the `const` is not in the `enum` |
| `format` | identical → dedupe | two **different** `format`s (no single value is two formats) |
| `title` / `description` / `default` | **last-wins**: identical values dedupe; when they differ the **last** branch's value survives (metadata, no validation effect); the `$ref`-sibling rewrite makes the use-site value override the target's. A lone value is kept. | never — a differing metadata value is an override, not a conflict |
| [[deprecated]] | **OR**: the merged node is deprecated if **any** branch marks it so. Not last-wins — deprecation is a warning that must not be silenced by a later branch omitting it (or writing `deprecated: false`, which is inert). | never |

### Numeric bounds ([[minimum]] / [[maximum]] / exclusives / [[multipleOf]])

Same-axis bounds **collapse to the tighter single bound** — this is the
tightening the numeric specs deferred here, and it means the merged result
never carries a same-axis *pair* on one node, so [[maximum]]'s single-node
redundancy reject never fires on merge output.

- **Lower bound:** among all `minimum`/`exclusiveMinimum` across branches,
  keep the one with the **greatest effective floor**. Inclusive `minimum:
  m` admits `≥ m`; exclusive `exclusiveMinimum: e` admits `> e`. Keep
  `exclusiveMinimum` iff `e ≥ m`, else `minimum` (collapsing the cross pair
  to whichever admits the smaller set).
- **Upper bound:** symmetric — keep the **smallest ceiling** among
  `maximum`/`exclusiveMaximum`. Inclusive `maximum: m` admits `≤ m`;
  exclusive `exclusiveMaximum: e` admits `< e`. Keep `exclusiveMaximum`
  iff `e ≤ m`, else `maximum`.
- **`multipleOf`:** the value must be a multiple of every divisor →
  merge to their **LCM**. All supported divisors are positive integers
  ([[multipleOf]]), so the LCM is a positive integer; no new form appears.
- **Then delegate satisfiability to [[maximum]]:** an empty interval
  (`minimum > maximum`, `minimum ≥ exclusiveMaximum`, the integer
  "no integer in range" case, or no multiple of the divisor in range) is
  [[maximum]]'s reject on the merged schema — not re-checked here.

### String / array / object length and count

All are "keep the tighter":

| Family | Lower keyword → keep | Upper keyword → keep |
|---|---|---|
| String length | `minLength` → **max** | `maxLength` → **min** |
| Array length | `minItems` → **max** | `maxItems` → **min** |
| Object size | `minProperties` → **max** | `maxProperties` → **min** |
| `contains` count | `minContains` → **max** | `maxContains` → **min** |

- `uniqueItems`: logical **OR** — `true` if any branch sets it (the
  tighter constraint wins).
- Emptiness (`min* > max*`) is the owning spec's satisfiability reject on
  the merged schema.

### Recursive-schema keywords

Keywords whose value is itself a schema (or a map of schemas) merge by
**recursing the same `allOf` merge** on the paired subschemas — both must
hold, and both are on the same value, so they compose the same way:

- `items`: merge the two item schemas.
- `properties`: **union** of property names; a name present in **both**
  branches has its two property subschemas merged recursively.
- `patternProperties`, `propertyNames`, `additionalProperties`
  (when a schema): merge recursively per matching pattern / on the single
  schema.
- `required`: **union** of the required names.
- `dependentRequired`: per trigger key, **union** the dependent-name lists.

### `additionalProperties: false` across branches

The flatten **resolves the notorious `allOf` + closed-object footgun**.
In raw JSON Schema, `additionalProperties` only sees its *own* branch's
`properties`, so `allOf: [{properties: {a}, additionalProperties: false},
{properties: {b}}]` rejects every object carrying `b`. Because the
generator **merges the property sets first**, `false` in any branch closes
the merged object against the **union** of all branches' declared
properties — the intuitive intent. This is a deliberate, documented
divergence from raw allOf validation semantics; it is coherent under
**P1** (all four targets generate from the one flattened schema and agree
value-for-value) and is the only behavior that lets base-type extension
with a closed base work at all. If **any** branch is closed, the merged
object is closed to the union; if all are open, it stays open (**P13**).

### Trivial and non-mergeable branches

- `true` / `{}` (empty schema): identity — contributes no constraint,
  dropped during flatten.
- `false`: unsatisfiable — nothing validates → **reject**.
- A branch that is itself a **combinator** (`oneOf`/`anyOf`/`not`/`if`):
  **reject**. An intersection with a union/negation/fork does not collapse
  to a single type (distributing a constraint across [[oneOf]] branches
  would produce an `anyOf` of merges — outside the subset). `anyOf`/`not`/
  `if` are rejected everywhere (**P6**); an `allOf` branch does not
  reintroduce them.
- Two **distinct** `pattern`s, `format`s, or `contains` schemas: **reject**
  as unmergeable — each is a constraint with no single-value representation
  (two regexes are not one regex; two existential matchers are two
  constraints). Identical values dedupe.

## Loader behavior

- `allOf` value not a **non-empty array of valid subschemas** → reject
  (recurse into each branch to report the inner fault).
- **Empty `allOf: []`** → reject: a no-op that validates everything
  (pointless wrapper, **P7.1**; fix-it: remove it).
- **Single-branch `allOf: [X]`** → reject: it is just `X` (pointless
  wrapper; fix-it: inline the branch), mirroring the single-branch
  [[oneOf]] reject.
- Flatten nested `allOf`, resolve `$ref` branches ([[ref]] rules; cycle →
  unsatisfiable reject), rewrite `$ref`-with-siblings to `allOf`, fold any
  keywords **sibling to `allOf`** in as a final branch, drop `true`/`{}`
  branches.
- `false` branch, or a branch that is a `oneOf`/`anyOf`/`not`/`if`
  combinator → reject.
- Fold per *Merge algorithm*. Reject the unmergeable pairs: disjoint
  `type`, disagreeing `const`, empty `enum` intersection, `const` violating
  a sibling constraint, differing `format`, distinct
  `pattern`/`contains`. A differing `title`/`description`/`default` is
  **not** an unmergeable pair — it is a last-wins override (see *Type and
  value sets*).
- Hand the merged schema to the ordinary loader; **all** satisfiability /
  shape / collision checks (empty interval, `min* > max*`, integer-range
  emptiness, synthesized-name **P15** collision) are the owning specs'
  rejects on the merged result, not restated here.

## Type mapping

`allOf` emits **nothing of its own.** The merged schema is lowered by the
keyword specs that own its surviving keywords — an object merge becomes an
ordinary object type ([[properties]]), a scalar merge a constrained scalar
([[type]] + the constraint families), and so on. There is no `AllOf`
wrapper type in any language.

Naming follows the ordinary rule ([[properties]] §"Synthesized type
names", reused verbatim by [[oneOf]]/[[const]]/[[enum]]):
- an `allOf` that **is** a named `$defs` entry takes the def name;
- an **anonymous** inline `allOf` that merges to an object/enum type is
  named `<EnclosingType><Property>` (Go flat / Java nested), while TS and
  Python inline it with no synthesized name.

Base-type extension therefore emits a flat, standalone type:

```yaml
$defs:
  Base:  { type: object, required: [id], properties: { id: {type: string} } }
  Sized: { type: object, properties: { size: {type: integer, minimum: 0} } }
  Widget:
    allOf:
      - { $ref: '#/$defs/Base' }
      - { $ref: '#/$defs/Sized' }
      - { type: object, required: [name], properties: { name: {type: string} } }
```

`Widget` merges to a single object with `{id, size, name}`, `required:
[id, name]` — copied fields, no inheritance. Every target emits it as it
would the hand-written combined object (Go struct, TS `interface`, Python
dataclass, Java POJO); `Base` and `Sized` remain their own types,
unrelated to `Widget`.

## Validator mapping

Per **P10**/**P11**/**P12**, with **nothing `allOf`-specific at runtime**:
the merged schema's constraints are validated by their own shared
`Validate` predicates in both directions, aggregated as always. Because the
`allOf` is gone after load, there is no "validate against each branch"
loop, no branch-selection, and no residual combinator — the tightened
bounds, unioned `required`, merged `properties`, and closed-object check
are indistinguishable from a hand-authored schema to every layer below the
loader. Reason strings come from the owning constraint families
(`minimum 4`, `maxLength 8`, …), never a bare `allOf`.

## Property-testing matrix

### Accepted (positive)

| Shape | Example |
|---|---|
| Tighten same-axis lower bounds | `{allOf:[{type:integer,minimum:3},{type:integer,minimum:4}]}` → `minimum:4` |
| Tighten across inclusive/exclusive | `{allOf:[{maximum:10},{exclusiveMaximum:8}]}` → `exclusiveMaximum:8` |
| Merge lower + upper into an interval | `{allOf:[{minimum:0},{maximum:100}]}` |
| `multipleOf` LCM | `{allOf:[{multipleOf:2},{multipleOf:3}]}` → `multipleOf:6` |
| String length tighten | `{allOf:[{minLength:2},{minLength:5},{maxLength:20}]}` |
| `enum` intersection | `{allOf:[{enum:[a,b,c]},{enum:[b,c,d]}]}` → `[b,c]` |
| `const` consistent with `enum`/range | `{allOf:[{const:5},{minimum:0,maximum:10}]}` |
| Object field union | `{allOf:[{properties:{a},required:[a]},{properties:{b},required:[b]}]}` → `{a,b}`, `required:[a,b]` |
| Overlapping property merged recursively | `{allOf:[{properties:{n:{minLength:2}}},{properties:{n:{maxLength:8}}}]}` |
| Base-type extension via `$ref` | `Widget` example above |
| `$ref`-with-siblings (implicit allOf) | `{$ref:'#/$defs/Base', minProperties:1}` |
| `allOf`-with-siblings (node keywords fold in, last) | `{allOf:[{$ref:'#/$defs/Base'}], properties:{extra:{type:string}}, required:[extra], description:"D"}` → `allOf:[{$ref:Base},{properties:{extra},required:[extra],description:"D"}]`; siblings extend Base, local `description` wins |
| Closed base + extension (footgun-fixed) | `{allOf:[{properties:{a},additionalProperties:false},{properties:{b}}]}` → closed to `{a,b}` |
| Nested `allOf` flattened | `{allOf:[{allOf:[{minimum:1}]},{maximum:9}]}` |
| Identity branch dropped | `{allOf:[{type:string,minLength:3},true]}` |
| Differing metadata annotation (last-wins) | `{allOf:[{default:1},{default:2}]}` → `2`; likewise `title`/`description` take the last branch's value (use-site sibling overrides a `$ref` target) |
| `deprecated` OR-merged | `{allOf:[{deprecated:true},{deprecated:false}]}` → deprecated; `{allOf:[{deprecated:true},{minimum:0}]}` → deprecated |

### Rejected at load time (negative)

| Reason | Example |
|---|---|
| Disjoint `type` (unsatisfiable) | `{allOf:[{type:string},{type:number}]}` |
| Empty numeric interval (delegated to [[maximum]]) | `{allOf:[{minimum:10},{maximum:5}]}` |
| Empty `enum` intersection | `{allOf:[{enum:[a,b]},{enum:[c,d]}]}` |
| Disagreeing `const` | `{allOf:[{const:1},{const:2}]}` |
| `const` violates a sibling | `{allOf:[{const:5},{maximum:4}]}` |
| Differing `format` | `{allOf:[{format:email},{format:uri}]}` |
| Distinct `pattern`s (no single regex) | `{allOf:[{pattern:'^a'},{pattern:'z$'}]}` |
| Distinct `contains` (two existentials) | `{allOf:[{contains:{const:1}},{contains:{const:2}}]}` |
| `false` branch (unsatisfiable) | `{allOf:[{type:object},false]}` |
| Branch is a combinator | `{allOf:[{type:object},{oneOf:[…]}]}`, `…{anyOf:[…]}`, `…{not:{…}}` |
| Empty array (pointless) | `{allOf:[]}` |
| Single-branch wrapper (pointless) | `{allOf:[{type:string}]}` → use the branch directly |
| Unresolvable / cyclic `$ref` branch | `{allOf:[{$ref:'#/$defs/Missing'}]}`; a type merging itself |
| Merged synthesized-name collision (P15) | two anonymous merges recasing to one Go type name (fix: `x-go-name`) |

### Runtime fixtures (validator)

There is **no `allOf`-specific runtime behavior** — fixtures exercise the
*merged* schema through the owning families:

- A value satisfying every merged bound (`7` against merged
  `minimum:4`/`maximum:10`) → OK both directions; a value failing the
  tightened bound (`3`) → one `Violation` from [[minimum]] naming
  `minimum 4` (the *tightened* value, not either original).
- An object missing a `required` name contributed by *either* branch →
  one `Violation` from [[required]].
- An overlapping-property value failing the *merged* property schema
  (`"a"` against a field merged to `minLength:2`+`maxLength:8` → still ok;
  `""` → one `Violation`).
- An object with an unknown key against a **closed-by-merge** object →
  one `Violation` (closed to the union of declared properties);
  the same object where all branches were open → key **preserved**
  (**P13**).
- A merged-in base field violating its own constraint on serialize →
  rejected before emit (**P12**) — identical to a hand-written field.
- A failing merged constraint alongside a failing sibling field → **both**
  reported in one shot (**P11**).

## Interactions

- **[[maximum]] / [[minimum]] / [[exclusiveMaximum]] / [[exclusiveMinimum]]
  / [[multipleOf]]**: the numeric specs reject a same-axis bound *pair on
  one node* as redundant, but explicitly defer the **cross-branch** case
  to here — two same-axis bounds from different `allOf` branches are
  **tightened** to one, and combined-interval / integer-range / divisor
  emptiness is delegated back to [[maximum]]'s satisfiability reject on the
  merged schema.
- **[[minLength]] / [[maxLength]] / [[minItems]] / [[maxItems]] /
  [[minProperties]] / [[maxProperties]] / [[minContains]] /
  [[maxContains]] / [[uniqueItems]]**: length/count bounds keep the
  tighter; emptiness is the owning spec's reject.
- **[[const]] / [[enum]]**: closed value sets **intersect** on merge (empty
  → reject); a `const` must be consistent with a merged `enum` and every
  other merged constraint. Reuses their exact value-equality and
  closed-set semantics (**P13.1**).
- **[[properties]] / [[required]] / [[additionalProperties]] /
  [[patternProperties]] / [[propertyNames]] / [[dependentRequired]]**:
  object keywords merge structurally — property union with recursive merge
  of shared names, `required` union, and the closed-object flatten that
  fixes the raw-allOf `additionalProperties:false` footgun. The
  synthesized-type naming rule is reused verbatim for the merged type.
- **[[items]] / [[contains]]**: `items` schemas merge recursively; distinct
  `contains` matchers are unmergeable (two existential constraints) →
  reject.
- **[[ref]]**: a branch may `$ref` a named typed def; the target is
  resolved and **folded in** (flatten, not subtype). `$ref`-with-siblings
  is the implicit-`allOf` sugar, now merged identically — **this
  supersedes [[ref]]'s former sibling-reject**. Ref resolution rules and
  the unsatisfiable-cycle reject are reused unchanged.
- **[[oneOf]]**: the sibling boolean-logic applicator that is admitted a
  *different* way — as a retained closed sum type with a decidable
  selector, because a union cannot collapse to one type. `allOf` collapses
  and disappears; `oneOf` stays and emits a union. An `allOf` branch that
  is itself a `oneOf` (or `anyOf`/`not`/`if`) is **rejected** — an
  intersection with a union does not collapse.
- **[[nullability]]**: nullability is expressed through [[type]]/[[oneOf]],
  not `allOf`; a `{type:"null"}` branch merged with any other kind is a
  disjoint-`type` reject.
- **[[dependentSchemas]] / [[unevaluatedProperties]] /
  [[unevaluatedItems]]**: the applicators that stay **rejected** (**P6**);
  `allOf` is the exception only because intersection materializes as one
  schema, which these do not.

## Ecosystem variance

| Source dialect | Action |
|---|---|
| JSON Schema 2020-12 | Native. Merged at load; mergeable branches supported, contradictory branches rejected. `$ref`-with-siblings is the implicit-`allOf` sugar, merged identically. |
| OpenAPI 3.1 | Adopts 2020-12 — `allOf` identical. The dominant OpenAPI use (base-type extension, `{allOf:[{$ref:Base},{extra}]}`) is exactly the flatten-merge case. |
| OpenAPI 3.0 / Swagger 2.0 | `allOf` exists with the same semantics and the same base-extension idiom; merged the same way. (3.0 `additionalProperties:false` composition inherits the same footgun-fix.) |
| draft-4..7 | `allOf` present since draft-4 with identical semantics. Only difference: pre-2020-12 `$ref` **ignored** its siblings, so a draft-07 `{$ref, …siblings}` validated as the bare `$ref`; we merge the siblings (2020-12 semantics) — a stricter, more faithful reading, noted as the one cross-draft behavior change. |
