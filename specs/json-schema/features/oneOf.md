# `oneOf`

Source: JSON Schema 2020-12, Core (Applicator vocabulary), §10.2.1.3
"Keywords for Applying Subschemas With Boolean Logic → oneOf".

The **tagged-union / sum-type** keyword: an instance is valid iff it
validates against **exactly one** branch. Among the boolean-logic
applicators, `oneOf` and [[allOf]] are the two the subset admits — but by
different mechanisms: `allOf` (intersection) collapses to a single
materialized schema at load ([[allOf]]), whereas `oneOf` is *retained* as a
closed sum type. [[anyOf]], [[not]], [[if-then-else]] stay **rejected** per
**P6** (see [[dependentSchemas]] for the same rationale). `oneOf` earns its
place because "exactly one" is a *sum
type*, which lowers coherently to all four targets — **but only when the
branches carry a decidable selector**, so a deserializer can route a wire
value to exactly one branch without trial-validating every subschema. Two
selectors are supported, composed in layers: the **JSON type token**
separates branches of different kinds, and — among two or more **object**
branches — a shared required **`const`-tag** property separates them by
value. Only the OpenAPI `discriminator` *object* is deferred (as optional
sugar over the const tag; see Support decision).

## Spec summary

Verbatim (2020-12 core, Applicator, §10.2.1.3):

> This keyword's value MUST be a non-empty array. Each item of the array
> MUST be a valid JSON Schema.

> An instance validates successfully against this keyword if it validates
> successfully against exactly one schema defined by this keyword's value.

Distilled:
- The value is a non-empty array of subschemas — the **branches**. The
  instance is valid iff **exactly one** branch validates: zero matches
  fails, and — unlike [[anyOf]] — **two or more** matches also fails.
- "Exactly one" is what makes it a sum type rather than an intersection
  ([[allOf]]) or an inclusive-or ([[anyOf]]). It is the only combinator
  whose semantics correspond to a single, closed, discriminated choice —
  the shape every target can model.
- The keyword says nothing about *how* to tell the branches apart;
  validity is defined by brute-force validation against all branches. A
  faithful *typed* lowering needs more than validity — it needs a
  **decidable selector** (below), or the deserializer is reduced to
  guessing (**P7**).

## Support decision

**Support:** yes, for a `oneOf` whose branches are separable by a
**decidable selector**. Concretely, the generator accepts a `oneOf` iff:

- it has **≥ 2 branches** (a single-branch `oneOf` is a pointless wrapper
  — reject per **P7.1**, diagnostic points at using the branch directly);
- **every branch declares a single recognized [[type]]** (directly, or via
  a `$ref` to a named typed definition) — a branch with no `type`, a
  boolean/empty schema (`true`/`false`/`{}`), or one that is itself a
  combinator has no classifiable kind and is rejected;
- **grouped by JSON kind** across {`null`, `boolean`, `string`, `number`,
  `array`, `object`}: every non-`object` kind holds **at most one** branch
  (type-token separable), and the `object` kind, if it holds **two or
  more** branches, is separated by a shared **`const`-tag discriminator**
  (below);
- every **object** branch has a **determinate type name**: a `$ref` brings
  its definition's name, a lone inline object branch derives `<Union>Object`,
  and two or more inline object branches must name themselves with
  `x-<lang>-name` (below).

Selection is layered. The outer selector is the wire token (`{`→object,
`[`→array, `"`→string, number→the numeric branch, `true`/`false`→boolean,
`null`→null). When the token is `{` and there are multiple object branches,
the inner selector reads the **discriminator property's value** and maps it
to the branch bearing that `const`. Because the branches are proven
disjoint at load (distinct kinds, and distinct `const` values within the
object kind), **at most one** branch can match, so "exactly one" decomposes
into two decidable checks:

- **≤ 1 (load time):** disjoint kinds + pairwise-distinct discriminator
  `const`s → no instance can satisfy two branches. Proven once, statically.
- **≥ 1 (runtime):** the token (then, for objects, the discriminator value)
  selects a branch and the value must validate against it; a token or
  discriminator value matching no branch is zero matches → a `Violation`.

This is why mixed-kind unions (`object | array`, `object | string`,
`string | integer`) and object tagged unions (`Cat | Dog`) are all
supported. The [[nullability]] pattern `oneOf:[{T},{null}]` is the
**degenerate two-kind instance** of the type-token layer (the `null` token
is the selector); it remains owned by [[nullability]].

### Object branches — naming the inline shape

An object branch is admitted whatever its shape (declared [[properties]], a
typed map, a free-form object, member-count bounds). The constraint is not
the shape, it is the **name**: every target has to materialize a *type* for a
**structured** object branch — Go a defined type to carry the marker method,
Java a class to `implement` the interface, TS an interface plus the converter
that validates its members, Python a dataclass plus the converter that validates
them — and a type needs a name. So every object branch must resolve to a
determinate name:

- **`$ref` to a named definition** — the definition's name *is* the branch
  type, already emitted with its own validation. The recommended form for
  any shape that is worth naming or is reused.
- **one inline object branch** — synthesizes `<Union>Object`, by the same
  rule the other inline branch kinds use (`<Union><Kind>`, [[properties]]
  §"Synthesized type names"). The name is determinate because the
  type-token layer admits a single object branch unless the branches are
  `const`-tagged. **P15** remains the backstop if `<Union>Object` collides
  with another emitted type: reject, with `x-<lang>-name` as the escape
  hatch — the same treatment every other synthesized name gets.
- **two or more inline object branches** (a `const`-tagged union written
  inline) — every branch would derive the same `Object` name, and there is
  nothing in a JSON Schema branch to derive a *distinguishing* name from:
  the discriminator's `const` value is a wire value, not an identifier, and
  ordinal names (`Object1`, `Object2`) reorder silently when a branch is
  inserted. So each branch must name itself with the Stage 4 override
  ([[properties]]) — `x-go-name` / `x-ts-name` / `x-py-name` /
  `x-java-name`, the key of whichever target is being generated — and is
  rejected naming the missing key otherwise.

A named branch is emitted as **the same named model an authored definition of
that shape would produce**: the load moves the branch into `$defs` under its
resolved name and rewrites the branch to a `$ref` at it, so there is one
object-model emitter per target rather than a second, inline one. Everything
downstream follows from that — the branch validates, resolves, collides
(**P15**), and joins the module's exported surface exactly like an authored
definition. It also means the inline form and the `$ref` form emit *identical*
code; the choice between them is only where the shape reads best.

Note what the multi-branch case costs: an override key per branch is more
typing than a `$defs` entry per branch, which also gives every target a
better name than a union-derived one. Inline multi-object branches are
admitted for completeness, not recommended; the diagnostic on a missing
override points at both remedies.

The **free-form object** (`type: object` with `additionalProperties: true`
and no declared `properties`) is the exception that needs no name at all *as
a branch*: it declares no shape to emit, so TS and Python express it
structurally inside the value union (`Record<string, unknown>` /
`dict[str, Any]`) and only Go and Java wrap it — as `<Union>Object` over the
verbatim member map ([[additionalProperties]], **P13**). It is left inline
rather than hoisted. This is specific to the branch position: written in a
value position of its own — a property, an element, a map member — a free-form
object *is* named and hoisted like any other object ([[properties]] §"Naming
an inline object shape").

### Discriminated object unions — the `const`-tag

Two or more **object** branches are separated by a shared discriminator
property. The generator accepts them iff there is **exactly one** property
name that, in **every** object branch:

- is listed in that branch's [[required]] array (so it is always on the
  wire to select on), and
- has a scalar **`const`** (a single-value [[enum]] is equivalent), with
  the `const` **values pairwise-distinct** across the branches.

That property is the **discriminator**; its `const` value is the inner
selector. This is the pure-JSON-Schema tagged-union idiom — no OpenAPI
`discriminator` object required — and it is **validation-bearing**: the
`const` is already enforced both directions ([[const]], **P12**), and the
discriminator is a **closed value set** (**P13.1**), so an unknown
discriminator value is *rejected*, not preserved. Keying selection on the
`const` value (not the `$ref` name) keeps it stable under type renaming.

- **Zero** shared required-`const` properties across the object branches →
  reject: no discriminator (diagnostic shows the const-tag form).
- **More than one** qualifying property → reject as **ambiguous** (**P7.1**);
  the deferred OpenAPI `discriminator` object is how one would later name
  the intended tag explicitly.
- The discriminator property is otherwise an ordinary member of each branch
  (emitted as the [[const]] literal); the rest of each branch is a normal
  open object (**P13**) — extra keys are still preserved *within* the
  selected branch. The tag closes selection *across* branches; it does not
  close the branches themselves.

Grounding ([[PRINCIPLES.md]]): **P1** — a sum type with a decidable
selector round-trips identically across all four targets; **P6** — the
selector requirement is the strict-subset line that admits `oneOf` as a
retained union while still excluding the non-collapsing applicators
(`anyOf`/`not`/`if`); **P7 / P7.1** — a selector-less
union (overlapping branches) would force trial-validation guessing, which
we reject loudly rather than approximate; **P2** — the type-token rule is
exactly the set of unions TypeScript can narrow with native
`typeof`/`Array.isArray` and Go/Java can decode by a single token peek, so
it reads like hand-written code in every language.

### Why a selector is required, not optional

The subset's objects are **open by default** ([[additionalProperties]],
**P13**): unknown keys are preserved, not rejected. Structural
discrimination ("does this payload match branch A's shape?") is therefore
unsound for object branches — an extra key never disqualifies a match, so
two object branches can both plausibly accept the same payload. This is
exactly why an explicit **`const`-tag** is required to separate object
branches: it is a closed value the wire must carry, immune to extra keys.
For *disjoint-kind* branches the JSON token itself is the tag —
self-describing, forward-compatible, and free.

### Null branches — nullable unions

`null` is one of the disjoint kinds, so a `null` branch is admitted like
any other. It doesn't add a sum-type *member*; it marks the whole field
**nullable**, and the remaining non-null branches form the value type:

- **exactly one non-null branch** (`[{T},{null}]`) → a plain nullable
  field, **owned by [[nullability]]** (its canonical two-branch pattern);
- **two or more non-null branches** (`[{object},{array},{null}]`) → a
  **nullable union**: the non-null branches form the sum type (and must
  themselves be pairwise-disjoint), and the field is nullable.

The nullable union needs no new machinery — every target already has a
nullable channel for the union type: a Go interface is nilable (`nil` =
`null`), Python adds `| None`, TS adds `| null`, and a Java
reference is `@Nullable`. The `null` token selects "no value" exactly as
the value tokens select their branches; decode/encode of the null state
follow the [[nullability]] tables over the union type (including the
optional-vs-null collapse in Go/Java/Python and the faithful round-trip in
TS). Required-vs-optional and the nullable state remain orthogonal
(**P8**), so all four presence/null combinations apply to a union just as
to a scalar.

### Unions in element positions

A union is not always a definition or a property. It can also be the
**element type** of a collection — an array's [[items]], a map's typed
[[additionalProperties]] — and there it is admitted on the same terms, with
one addition: it needs a name, for the same reason a structured object branch
does. Go emits a union as a sealed interface plus a dispatcher, Java as an
interface with a static `fromNode`; a `[]T` / `List<T>` over that interface
has to name `T`.

So a `oneOf` **sum type** in an element position is *named after its
position*, moved into `$defs`, and the position rewritten to a `$ref` at it:

| Position | Synthesized name |
|---|---|
| `items` of the property `values` on `Bag` | `BagValuesItem` |
| `items` of `items` (nested array) | `BagValuesItemItem` |
| `additionalProperties` of the definition `Entries` | `EntriesValue` |
| `items` of a union's array branch | `<Union>ArrayItem` |

The branch's own `x-<lang>-name` overrides the derived name, and **P15**
rejects a collision rather than mangling — the rules every synthesized name
follows. Because the hoist runs to a fixpoint, an inline *object branch* of a
hoisted element union is named in turn (`BagValuesItemObject`), so the
element position needs no `$defs` boilerplate from the author for any shape.
An inline *object* in an element position is named by the same rule and the
same table ([[properties]] §"Naming an inline object shape") — the positions
and their names are shared; only what occupies them differs.

Two consequences worth stating:

- **The naming is uniform across targets.** An anonymous union on a
  *property* stays inline in TS/Python (only Go/Java synthesize
  `<Enclosing><Property>`), but an element union is a `$defs` definition
  before any backend sees it, so all four emit the same named type. That is
  the point: one hoist replaces four element-position emitters.
- **The nullability `oneOf` is not hoisted.** `items: {oneOf: [{T},{null}]}`
  has one non-null branch, so it is [[nullability]]'s degenerate pattern, not
  a sum type: it declares nothing to name and every target expresses it on
  the element itself (`[]*T`, `(T | null)[]`, `list[T | None]`,
  `List<@Nullable T>` — see [[items]]).

Element decoding is elementwise by necessity: a whole-collection decode
(`json.Unmarshal` into `[]T`, `readTreeAsValue(node, T.class)`) cannot
allocate a sealed interface. Each element/member is routed through the
union's own dispatcher, and its index or key is threaded into the violation
path (`shapes[1]`, `choices.primary`) per **P11**.

The reverse nesting is recursive too: when an **array is itself a union
branch**, the selected branch uses the ordinary [[items]] parser and mapper in
both directions. It does not pass the array through verbatim. Element models,
temporals, and binary values therefore materialize normally, every element's
constraints run, and failures aggregate at indexed paths under the union.

### Deferred (reject with a "not yet supported" diagnostic)

- **The OpenAPI `discriminator: {propertyName, mapping}` object** — the
  explicit form that names the tag property and maps values to schemas. It
  is deferred as *optional sugar* over the const-tag form: when accepted, it
  must be **consistent with** the branch `const`s (each mapped value's
  branch must already carry that `const`), so the `const` stays the single
  validation-bearing source of truth and we don't inherit the
  discriminator object's `$ref`-name brittleness. Until then it is rejected
  with a diagnostic pointing at the const-tag form, which needs no OpenAPI
  extension.

- **A materializing keyword on a non-object branch of a sum type** — a temporal
  [[format]] (`date-time`/`date`/`time`/`duration`) or a [[contentEncoding]].
  Both replace the wire `string` with a native typed value (`time.Time` /
  `OffsetDateTime` / `datetime` / `Temporal.*`; `[]byte` / `byte[]` / `bytes`),
  and the synthesized `<Union><Kind>` wrapper has no such type: the branch would
  materialize in Python while Go, TypeScript, and Java carried an unvalidated
  `string`, which is exactly the silent per-target divergence **P1** forbids. So
  it is rejected with a located diagnostic naming the keyword and the two
  remedies — drop the keyword to keep the branch a plain (still fully validated)
  `string`, or carry the value as a *property* of an object branch, where
  materialization already works. Non-materializing string formats (`uuid`,
  `email`, `hostname`, `uri`, `ipv4`, `ipv6`) are **not** deferred: they assert
  and keep the `string`, so they ride along like any other branch constraint.
  This is scoped to the sum type — the [[nullability]] pattern
  `oneOf:[{T},{null}]` has a single non-null branch and synthesizes no wrapper,
  so a materialized nullable field is unaffected.

### Rejected outright (incoherent, not merely unsupported)

- **`integer | number`** — both are the JSON number token *and*
  `integer ⊂ number`, so any integer satisfies both branches: `oneOf`'s
  exactly-one is **unsatisfiable**. Reject per **P7.1** (not deferred — no
  discriminator can fix an overlap). Distinct numeric-vs-non-numeric pairs
  (`integer | string`, `number | boolean`) are fine.
- **Empty `oneOf: []`** — the value MUST be non-empty; reject as an
  invalid schema.

Loader behavior:
- `oneOf` value not a non-empty array of valid subschemas → reject
  (recurse into each branch).
- Single-branch `oneOf` → reject (**P7.1**, pointless wrapper).
- Any branch without a single recognized `type` (missing `type`,
  `true`/`false`/`{}`, a nested combinator) → reject: no classifiable kind.
- Two or more **object** branches → require the `const`-tag discriminator
  (exactly one shared required-`const` property, pairwise-distinct values);
  zero such properties or more than one qualifying → reject (no
  discriminator / ambiguous).
- An **inline** structured object branch (declared `properties`, or a typed
  `additionalProperties`) → resolve its name (below), move it into `$defs`
  under that name, and rewrite the branch to a `$ref` at it. From that point
  it is an ordinary model. The free-form object is left inline.
- Two or more **inline** structured object branches without a per-branch
  `x-<lang>-name` for the target being generated → reject: the synthesized
  `<Union>Object` name is not determinate. The diagnostic names the missing
  key and points at `$defs` + `$ref` as the shorter remedy.
- A synthesized branch name already declared in `$defs`, or colliding with
  another emitted type → reject per **P15**, `x-<lang>-name` as the escape
  hatch (as for every synthesized name).
- A `oneOf` **sum type** written inline in an element position (an array's
  `items` at any depth, an object's typed `additionalProperties`) → name it
  after its position (below), move it into `$defs`, and rewrite the position to
  a `$ref` at it, exactly as for an inline object branch. Its own inline object
  branches are then named in turn.
- An **inline** object branch in a position with no derivable name (a nested
  inline object's property, whose enclosing shape is itself not materialized —
  see [[properties]]) → reject unless it is the free-form object, which needs
  none; the diagnostic points at `$defs` + `$ref`.
- Two or more branches of the same **non-object** kind (two strings, two
  integers) → reject: a scalar same-kind choice is an [[enum]] (or `const`
  union), not a `oneOf` — diagnostic points at [[enum]].
- `integer` and `number` branches together → reject (unsatisfiable
  overlap).
- A `null` branch with exactly one other branch → hand off to
  [[nullability]] (its canonical two-branch pattern); with two or more
  others → accept as a **nullable union** (null marks the field nullable;
  the non-null branches form the sum type).
- Synthesized union type name collides after case-mapping → reject per
  **P15** (`x-<lang>-name` on the declaring member/definition is the
  escape hatch), exactly as [[const]]/[[enum]] synthesized types.

## Type mapping

A supported `oneOf` emits a **closed sum type** — a value that holds
exactly one of the branch types, structurally (the in-memory
representation cannot hold two, so the "exactly one" invariant is carried
by the type itself; the runtime check is only *which* branch on decode).

The union type is **named** by the same rule [[const]]/[[enum]] synthesized
types use ([[properties]] §"Synthesized type names"): a named `$defs`
union reuses the def name; an **anonymous** inline union on a property is
named `<EnclosingType><Property>` (Go flat / Java nested), while TS and
Python inline the union with no synthesized name. A union in an **element
position** is named and hoisted at load (§"Unions in element positions"), so
by the time a backend sees it, it *is* a named `$defs` union in every
language.

Running example (named union in `$defs`):

```yaml
$defs:
  Widget: { type: object, properties: { size: { type: integer } } }
  Foo:
    oneOf:
      - { $ref: '#/$defs/Widget' }        # object branch
      - { type: string }                  # string branch
      - { type: array, items: { type: number } }   # array branch
```

### TypeScript

A bare union — inline on the field, or a `type` alias for a `$def`. No
synthesized name; narrowing is native (**PRINCIPLES TS §2** — structural
types, no runtime footprint):

```ts
export type Foo = Widget | string | number[];

function handle(f: Foo) {
  if (typeof f === "string") {        // f: string
  } else if (Array.isArray(f)) {      // f: number[]
  } else {                            // f: Widget
  }
}
```

The type-token selector maps 1:1 onto TS's built-in narrowing primitives
(`typeof`, `Array.isArray`, and — for object-vs-object — a discriminant
literal property). This is the best-fit target: the acceptance rule is
*exactly* what TS narrows without hand-written type guards (**P2**).

An inline object branch is the one place TS does need a name: the branch's
members have to be validated, and that validation lives in a
`TransferTypeConverter` keyed to a type. A **structured** inline branch is
therefore emitted as the interface + converter pair a named definition gets
(`<Union>Object`, or the
branch's `x-ts-name`) and enters the union under that name; the union still
narrows structurally, on the object token or the discriminant literal. Only the
**free-form** branch stays anonymous — it has no members to validate:

```ts
export interface FooObject { kind: "a"; value: string; additionalProperties: Record<string, unknown>; }
export type Foo = FooObject | string;                      // structured inline branch
export type Bar = Record<string, unknown> | string;        // free-form inline branch
```

A property-level (anonymous) union whose members need a transform gets one
module-private `serialize<Union>` function — the same dispatch a named union's
`toTransferType` performs — so an object member is written through its branch
converter rather than emitted with its in-memory `additionalProperties` member
intact.

### Python

A PEP 604 union, inline on the field; a named `$def` becomes a
`TypeAlias`:

```python
Foo: typing.TypeAlias = Widget | str | list[float]     # TypeAlias for the $def
```

This is structurally the TypeScript design — a plain type plus an off-type
converter that owns both directions — with one mechanical difference: a
`TypeAlias` cannot carry a decorator and `type[A | B]` is not a valid
annotation, so a union gets **no** `_<Model>TransferTypeConverter` class
(**PRINCIPLES Python §3**). Its conversion is emitted as a pair of
module-private free functions instead:

```python
def _foo_from_transfer_type(
    value: typing.Any, path: str, violations: list[Violation]
) -> Foo | None: ...

def _foo_to_transfer_type(value: Foo) -> typing.Any: ...
```

The parse function classifies the wire token, delegates to the selected
branch, and appends any `Violation` to the caller's list — returning `None`
on failure so its siblings are still checked (**P11**); the serialize
function dispatches on the in-memory value's Python type. An inline
property-level union gets the same pair, named after its position
(`_<model>_<property>_from_transfer_type` / `_..._to_transfer_type`) — the
analogue of TS's module-private `serialize<Model><Property>`.

One consequence worth stating: a union carries no *registered* converter, so
it cannot be a top-level Nexus operation input/output type. That costs
nothing — the loader already requires operation I/O to be an object type and
rejects a `oneOf` there ([[services]]) — so a union only ever appears
nested, where the declaring model's converter calls these functions.

For an object tagged union the `const` tag stays a `typing.Literal` member of
each branch ([[const]]) and the parse function switches on the discriminant
value read out of the raw dict (see "Discriminated object unions" below).

Python inlines the union but **not** a structured object branch's shape: the
branch's members have to be validated, and that validation lives in a
converter keyed to a type, so such a branch becomes a module-level dataclass
named by the rule above (`<Union>Object`, or the branch's `x-py-name`) and
enters the union under that name. The free-form object is the exception —
`dict[str, typing.Any]` has no declared members to validate and needs no
class.

```python
@_transfer_type_convertible(_FooObjectTransferTypeConverter)
@dataclasses.dataclass(slots=True, kw_only=True)
class FooObject: ...                      # the inline object branch

Foo: typing.TypeAlias = FooObject | str
```

### Go

A **sealed interface** with an unexported marker method (**Option B**);
the field is the bare interface, type-switched directly (no wrapper, no
accessor):

```go
type Foo interface{ isFoo() }

func (Widget) isFoo() {}          // a $ref/named branch implements the marker directly
type FooString string             // a non-nameable branch gets a synthesized variant type…
func (FooString) isFoo() {}
type FooArray []float64           // …named <Union><Kind>
func (FooArray) isFoo() {}

type Container struct {
    Value Foo `json:"value"`
}

switch v := c.Value.(type) {      // direct type switch on the field
case Widget:     use(v)
case FooString:  use(string(v))
case FooArray:   use([]float64(v))
}
```

The marker method is unexported, so **only generator-emitted types
implement the interface** — the set is closed by construction. Any branch
that is (or `$ref`s) a named Go type implements the marker directly; an
inline scalar/array/object branch synthesizes a variant type named
`<Union><Kind>` (Go has no nested types → flat, P15-backstopped, or the
branch's `x-go-name` when it carries one). Because at most one branch
occupies each kind, `<Union><Kind>` is unambiguous.

An inline **object** branch synthesizes `<Union>Object` as a **struct** —
the same struct a named definition of that shape gets, fields and validation
included — rather than a defined type over a map, because the interface
requires the standard `Validate`/`UnmarshalJSON`/`MarshalJSON` surface:

```go
type FooObject struct {                      // a structured inline branch
    Kind  FooObjectKind `json:"kind"`
    Value string        `json:"value"`
}
func (FooObject) isFoo() {}

type BarObject struct {                      // a free-form inline branch
    AdditionalProperties map[string]json.RawMessage
}
func (BarObject) isBar() {}
```

Both the interface type and each synthesized `<Union><Kind>` variant are
exported, so both carry a name-led doc comment (PRINCIPLES.md, Go §1): the
interface from the union schema's [[title]]/[[description]] when present,
else a fallback listing its admissible branch kinds (`// Foo is one of:
string, []float64, Widget.`); a synthesized variant from its own branch
schema's [[title]]/[[description]], else a fallback naming the union and
wrapped kind it belongs to. The unexported marker method needs none.

### Java

Java 8 baseline (**PRINCIPLES Java §1**) has no sealed interfaces, so the
union is a **plain interface, sealed by convention** — the `fromNode`
dispatcher it carries only ever constructs the known variants:

```java
public interface Foo {
    // The collecting dispatcher (§5): reads one JsonNode into a variant, or
    // records a Violation and returns null.
    static @Nullable Foo fromNode(JsonNode node, String path, List<Violation> violations, DeserializationContext context) { … }

    // Widget implements Foo (object branch — the POJO gains `implements Foo`)
    public static final class FooString implements Foo { private final String value; /* ctor, @JsonValue getter */ }
    public static final class FooArray  implements Foo { private final List<Double> value; /* … */ }
}
```

Java has no union type: an object `$ref` branch just gains `implements
Foo` on its existing POJO, while a **scalar/array branch must be wrapped**
in a variant class (`String` can't implement an interface). This wrapping
is the cost only of the *tagless token-based* form (mixed kinds); a pure
object tagged union of `$ref` branches has no wrappers — every branch is
already a POJO. The verbosity is hidden behind the POJO style (**P2**).

The wrapper's `getValue()` carries Jackson's `@JsonValue`, so a wrapper writes
back as the value it holds rather than as a bean around it; that makes the
serialize side a single runtime-class dispatch for every branch kind (an object
branch writes through its POJO's serializer, a wrapper through `@JsonValue`).

An inline object branch has no POJO to gain `implements`, so one is emitted for
it, named by the rule above (`<Union>Object`, or the branch's `x-java-name`). A
**structured** branch becomes a top-level POJO like any definition, taking part
in the interface's `fromNode` dispatch. A **free-form** branch instead becomes a
wrapper class over the catch-all member type an open POJO uses
([[additionalProperties]]), so its members round-trip verbatim:

```java
public final class FooObject implements Foo { /* declared members + collecting (de)serializer */ }
public static final class BarObject implements Bar { private final Map<String, JsonNode> value; /* … */ }
```

A **property-level** union is the same interface — `fromNode`, wrappers and all —
declared *nested in the enclosing POJO* (`Showcase.Detail`) rather than in its own
file, and the enclosing deserializer reads the member with the identical
`Detail.fromNode(…)` call a named union def gets. A structured branch of such a
union is still a top-level POJO; it names the nested interface through its
declaring class:

```java
public final class ShowcaseDetailObject implements Showcase.Detail { /* … */ }
```

### Nullable unions

A `null` branch adds no member type; it makes the union field nullable
using each target's existing nullable channel ([[nullability]]), applied
to the union type rather than a scalar:

| | value type | nullable form |
|---|---|---|
| Go | `Foo` (interface) | already nilable — `nil` = `null`; no `*Foo` wrapper |
| TypeScript | `Foo` | `Foo \| null` (optional adds `?`) |
| Python | `Foo` (`TypeAlias`) | `Foo \| None` |
| Java | `Foo` | `@Nullable Foo` |

The presence/null state machine (required+nullable emits `null`, optional
collapses in Go/Java/Python, faithful in TS) is exactly the
[[nullability]] serialize/round-trip tables, unchanged — the union type
simply takes the place of the scalar.

### Discriminated object unions

Two or more object branches separated by a `const`-tag emit the same
closed sum type; the tag is an ordinary member of each branch, emitted as
the [[const]] literal, and drives selection.

```yaml
$defs:
  Cat: { type: object, required: [kind], properties: { kind: {type: string, const: cat}, meow: {type: string} } }
  Dog: { type: object, required: [kind], properties: { kind: {type: string, const: dog}, bark: {type: string} } }
  Animal: { oneOf: [ {$ref: '#/$defs/Cat'}, {$ref: '#/$defs/Dog'} ] }
```

- **TypeScript** — a discriminated union; the tag is a literal, narrowed by
  `switch`:
  ```ts
  interface Cat { kind: "cat"; meow: string; }
  interface Dog { kind: "dog"; bark: string; }
  export type Animal = Cat | Dog;
  switch (a.kind) { case "cat": /* Cat */ break; case "dog": /* Dog */ break; }
  ```
- **Python** — dataclass branches plus the union's parse function switching
  on the tag:
  ```python
  @dataclasses.dataclass(slots=True, kw_only=True)
  class Cat: kind: typing.Literal["cat"] = "cat"; meow: str
  @dataclasses.dataclass(slots=True, kw_only=True)
  class Dog: kind: typing.Literal["dog"] = "dog"; bark: str
  Animal: typing.TypeAlias = Cat | Dog
  # _animal_from_transfer_type: raw["kind"] == "cat" → Cat's converter ;
  #   "dog" → Dog's ; else a Violation naming the admissible values
  ```
- **Go** — the sealed interface; the container's `UnmarshalJSON` peeks the
  discriminator on an object token, then unmarshals into the concrete
  struct:
  ```go
  type Animal interface{ isAnimal() }
  func (Cat) isAnimal() {}
  func (Dog) isAnimal() {}
  // decode: raw["kind"] == "cat" → *Cat ; "dog" → *Dog ; else Violation
  ```
- **Java** — every branch is already a POJO implementing the interface;
  the collecting deserializer (**PRINCIPLES Java §5**) peeks the
  discriminator `JsonNode` and dispatches to the matching POJO's collecting
  deserializer (keeping P11 aggregation — the reason we peek rather than
  lean on Jackson's fail-fast `@JsonTypeInfo`, though the const tag is
  exactly what an `@JsonTypeInfo(use=NAME, include=EXISTING_PROPERTY)` form
  would key on).

## Validator mapping

Per **P10**/**P11**/**P12**. "Exactly one" is decomposed as above: the
disjointness invariant (distinct kinds + distinct discriminator `const`s)
is proven at **load** (so ≤ 1 is structural and needs no runtime work), and
the boundary enforces **≥ 1** by routing the wire token — then, for an
object token with a multi-branch object kind, the **discriminator value** —
to its branch and validating the value against that branch's own shared
predicates. A token *or* discriminator value matching no branch → one
`Violation`. The discriminator is a **closed value set** (**P13.1**): an
unknown discriminator value is rejected, not preserved (unlike a branch's
own unknown *members*, which stay open per **P13**). This is **selection
then delegate**, never a trial-all-branches loop.

| Language | Strategy |
|---|---|
| Go | The container's collecting `UnmarshalJSON` (shadow `*json.RawMessage` layout, **PRINCIPLES Go** / [[nullability]]) peeks the field's first non-space token, routes to the branch of that kind (`{`→object; `[`→array: `FooArray`; `"`→string: `FooString`; number→the numeric branch via `parseSpecInteger`/spec-number so `1.5` still yields a `Violation`). For an object token with 2+ object branches it further reads the discriminator property and selects the branch with that `const`. It then runs that branch's shared `Validate` and assigns the concrete type to the interface field. No matching kind / unknown discriminator value → `Violation` collected into the single `PayloadValidationError` application failure. |
| TypeScript | `fromTransferType` is the `typeof`/`Array.isArray` chain shown above; for an object it switches on the discriminant literal (`raw.kind`) and delegates to that branch's converter (e.g. `catTransferTypeConverter.fromTransferType`); the fall-through pushes one `Violation`. Plain checks only (**PRINCIPLES TS §1** — no runtime schema lib). |
| Python | The union's module-private `_<union>_from_transfer_type(value, path, violations)`, called by the declaring model's `_<Model>TransferTypeConverter` (**PRINCIPLES Python §3**), classifies the raw value with `isinstance` — `dict`→object, `list`→array, `str`→string, a non-`bool` `int`/`float`→the numeric branch via `_parse_spec_integer`/the spec-number rule so `1.5` still yields a `Violation`, `bool`→boolean, `None`→null. For an object token with 2+ object branches it reads the discriminator key out of the raw dict and delegates to that branch's converter, re-pathing its `PayloadValidationError` application failure under the current path with `_collect`. No decidable branch / unknown discriminator value → a `Violation` appended and `None` returned, so sibling members are still checked and the model's converter raises the one `PayloadValidationError` application failure (**PRINCIPLES Python §2**). |
| Java | The union interface's static `fromNode` (called by the enclosing POJO's collecting deserializer, **PRINCIPLES Java §5**) switches on the `JsonNode` kind (`isObject`/`isArray`/`isTextual`/`isNumber`/`isBoolean`); for an object with 2+ object branches it peeks the discriminator node and dispatches to the matching POJO's collecting deserializer. On no match / unknown discriminator it pushes a `Violation` into the single `PayloadValidationError` application failure and returns `null`. One dispatcher serves both positions: a named union def and a union written inline on a property. |

Reason strings name **what was expected**, never a bare `oneOf`, per the
informative-reason convention the constraint families use: no decidable
branch → `expected one of: <labels>` over the admissible kinds / branch
types; an object whose discriminator value matches no branch →
`unknown discriminator <field> <value>: expected one of [...]` over the
admissible tag values. Both strings are identical in all four targets.

### Branch constraints

Selection is only half of it. A branch is an ordinary schema, so once the
selector routes a value to one, that value is held to **everything that branch
declares** — and to nothing the other branches declare. An **object** branch gets
this for free: it is a named model ([[properties]]), so it validates through its
own model's checks. A **non-object** branch has no model, so the type each target
synthesizes for it carries the branch's predicates instead — the same emitters,
with the same reasons, a *property* of that type would use (`minLength`/`maxLength`
/`pattern`/`format`, the numeric bounds and `multipleOf`, `minItems`/`maxItems`/
`uniqueItems`/`contains`, a `const`/`enum` value set), under the union's own
violation path (`idOrName`, `shapes[1]`, `choices.primary`):

| Language | Where a non-object branch's constraints live |
|---|---|
| Go | the synthesized `<Union><Kind>` wrapper's `Validate`, over a conversion back to the underlying type (`string(v)`, `[]float64(v)`). The dispatcher calls it on the selected branch, and the declaring model's `Validate` — which `MarshalJSON` runs first — calls it again before emit. A branch `pattern`/`format` compiles to a package-level regex var keyed by the wrapper type (`fooStringPattern`). |
| TypeScript | the narrowing chain itself: each `typeof`/`Array.isArray` arm runs the branch's checks over the narrowed value, in `fromTransferType` and again on the serialize side (a named union in its own converter's `toTransferType`, an inline one in the declaring model's, so a branch violation aggregates with its siblings). |
| Python | the classification arm itself, exactly as in TypeScript: each `isinstance` arm runs the branch's checks over the classified value — the numeric bounds, length bounds, `multipleOf`, and the `pattern`/`format` regex match all inline; only `uniqueItems` and `contains` go through a runtime helper (`_check_unique_items` / `_check_contains`) — in `_<union>_from_transfer_type` and again in `_<union>_to_transfer_type`, so a branch violation aggregates with its siblings. Selecting the branch *is* validating it. |
| Java | a package-private `validate(path, violations)` on the wrapper class, with its compiled `pattern`/`format` `Pattern` statics. `fromNode` calls it on the wrapper it just built; the interface's static `validate` dispatches on the member's runtime class and is called by the declaring POJO's `Serializer` (and per element/member for a collection of unions) before any wire member is written. |

A **closed value set** (`const`/`enum`) on a branch closes the *type* where the
target can express that — a TypeScript literal union (`"auto" | "manual" | number`),
a Python `typing.Literal` — and is a membership check in the validator in Go and Java,
which have no field to hang a defined type or value class off (the same treatment a
typed map's member gets, [[additionalProperties]] §"Per-member `T` validation").
The accepted value set is identical in all four.

### Serialize-side (P12)

The in-memory value **is** a single branch member, so "exactly one" is
structurally guaranteed and the encode adapter simply emits the held
variant: Go `json.Marshal` on the interface marshals its dynamic type (a
`FooString`/`FooArray` named type serializes as its underlying JSON kind;
an object branch emits its fields); TS `toTransferType` branches on
`typeof`/`Array.isArray` and delegates to the member's converter; Java's
`Serializer` writes by runtime class; Python's
`_<union>_to_transfer_type` dispatches on the member's Python type with
`isinstance` and calls the branch's converter. The shared `Validate` still
**re-runs the selected branch's constraints before emit**, so an in-memory
member violating its own branch's rules fails serialize with the same
aggregated primitive rather than being written (real teeth where
construction is unchecked).

Python's serialize dispatch tests every branch but the last, then falls
through to it. The fallthrough is safe by **precondition**:
`_<union>_to_transfer_type` runs the union's checks — each branch's own
constraints and the no-branch-matched test — and raises the aggregated
`PayloadValidationError` application failure *before* the dispatch, so a value that reaches the
guards is already known to match some branch and the final `isinstance`
is redundant. Emitting it anyway would leave the guard and the
`expected one of` raise behind it statically unreachable.

Those checks live in that function for every union that has one, named or
inline, which is what puts them ahead of the dispatch — the only place
that can stop it. A union no branch of which transforms its value needs no
such function at all: the member is emitted as-is and the declaring
model's converter runs the checks inline. Either way the violations are
reported under the member's path — a union function collects them at the
empty path and the declaring converter re-paths them through `_collect`
(**P11**) — and aggregate with the member's siblings.

The parse direction, which is handed untrusted input rather than a value
of the declared union type, tests every branch and raises
`expected one of: <labels>` with no fallthrough.

### Runtime fixtures (validator)

- Wire value whose token selects a branch and validates → OK, bound to
  that variant (both directions).
- Token selects a branch but the value fails that branch's constraints
  (`""` for `{type:string,minLength:3}`) → one `Violation` from the branch
  predicate.
- Token matches **no** branch (`true` against `Widget | string |
  number[]`) → one `Violation` naming the admissible kinds.
- `1.5` against a `string | integer` union → routed to the integer branch,
  rejected by the spec-number rule (**P12** parse adapter), not truncated.
- Object with `kind:"cat"` against `Cat | Dog` → bound to `Cat`; extra
  unknown keys on the object are **preserved** (branch stays open, **P13**).
- Object against a free-form object branch → every member preserved
  verbatim, large integers untruncated, and re-emitted unchanged (**P13**).
- Object with `kind:"fish"` (unknown discriminator) → one `Violation`
  naming the admissible values (`cat`, `dog`) — closed value set (**P13.1**),
  not preserved.
- Object with the discriminator **absent** → one `Violation` (it is
  `required`); the deserializer never falls back to trial-matching branches.
- `null` against a nullable union (`Widget | number[] | null`) → accepted
  as the null state (required+nullable) / omitted-or-null per the
  [[nullability]] serialize table (optional); `null` against a
  non-nullable union → one `Violation`.
- A branch constraint is enforced **only for the branch the token selected**:
  `"ab"` against `{oneOf:[{type:string,minLength:3},{type:integer,minimum:1}]}`
  → one length `Violation`; `0` against the same union → one `minimum`
  `Violation` (never the string branch's).
- An array branch's own bounds: `[]` against
  `{type:array,minItems:1,uniqueItems:true}` → one `minItems` `Violation`;
  `[1.5,1.5]` → one duplicate-items `Violation`.
- A `const`/`enum` branch: an off-set string → one `Violation` naming the
  admissible values, while the sibling numeric branch stays unbounded.
- Serialize of an in-memory member violating its branch's own constraints
  → rejected before emit (**P12**), aggregated with any failing sibling field.
- A union-typed array element / map member: each value routed
  independently, with a failing one reported under its index or key
  (`shapes[1]`, `choices.primary`) and the rest still checked (**P11**).
- Serialize of an array of union members: each member's own branch
  constraints re-run before emit (**P12**).
- A failing union combined with a failing sibling field → **both**
  reported in one shot (**P11**).

## Interactions

- **[[nullability]]**: owns the two-branch `oneOf:[{T},{null}]` pattern —
  the degenerate type-token case (the `null` token is the selector) — and
  the per-language nullable encoding/serialize tables. A `null` branch
  among 3+ kinds is a **nullable union**: supported here, reusing those
  same tables over the union type (the `null` branch marks the field
  nullable, the non-null branches form the sum type).
- **[[const]] / [[enum]]**: the `const`-tag discriminator's basis — the
  validation-bearing selector for object branches, reusing [[const]]'s
  exact value-equality (already enforced both directions, **P12**) and its
  closed-value-set rejection of unknowns (**P13.1**); a single-value
  [[enum]] is an equivalent tag. Same-kind *scalar* branches are an [[enum]]
  rather than a `oneOf`. Also: [[properties]]'s synthesized-type naming rule
  — reused verbatim here for the union type name.
- **[[type]]**: every branch must declare one recognized `type` (or `$ref`
  to a typed def); it supplies the JSON kind that is the selector. A
  branch's own [[type]] siblings (formats, numeric/string constraints)
  validate normally once the branch is selected.
- **[[ref]]**: a branch may be a `$ref` to a named typed definition; the
  resolved type supplies the kind, and (in Go/Java) that named type
  implements the union marker / interface directly rather than being
  wrapped.
- **[[additionalProperties]]**: object openness (**P13**) is *why*
  same-kind object branches need an explicit `const` tag — extra keys never
  disqualify a structural match. The tag closes selection *across* branches
  while each branch stays open *within* (unknown members preserved), so the
  two concerns coexist: closed discriminator, open payload. It also supplies
  the **free-form object** — the one inline branch shape that needs no name at
  all (it declares nothing to emit) — and the per-language member
  representation its Go/Java wrapper reuses.
- **[[required]]**: the discriminator property **must** be `required` in
  every object branch — otherwise a payload could omit it and be
  unselectable. Separately, whether the whole union-typed member is present
  is its own `required` question; an absent optional union raises no
  `oneOf` violation (**P8**).
- **[[allOf]]**: the *other* admitted boolean-logic applicator, but by a
  different mechanism — intersection **collapses to one type at load** (a
  merge/flatten), so it disappears downstream, whereas `oneOf` is retained
  and emits a union. An `allOf` branch that is itself a `oneOf` is rejected
  ([[allOf]]): an intersection with a union does not collapse.
- **[[anyOf]] / [[dependentSchemas]] / [[not]] / [[if-then-else]]**: the
  boolean-logic / conditional applicators that stay **rejected** per
  **P6**. `oneOf` is admitted because "exactly one" is a *closed sum type*
  with a decidable selector, which inclusive-or ([[anyOf]]), negation
  ([[not]]), and runtime shape-forking ([[if-then-else]] / [[dependentSchemas]])
  are not.

## Ecosystem variance

| Source dialect | Action |
|---|---|
| JSON Schema 2020-12 | Native. Type-token-separable unions (incl. nullable unions), plus object tagged unions via a shared required-`const` discriminator. `integer`+`number` overlap rejected. |
| OpenAPI 3.1 | Adopts 2020-12 — `oneOf` identical; the const-tag form works unchanged. The 3.1 `discriminator: {propertyName, mapping}` object is **deferred** (will be accepted as optional sugar over the `const`-tag form, consistency-checked against the branch `const`s). |
| OpenAPI 3.0 / Swagger 2.0 | `oneOf` exists (3.0) with the same exactly-one semantics; the standalone `discriminator` is the same deferred sugar. Swagger 2.0 has no `oneOf`. |
| draft-4..7 | `oneOf` present since draft-4 with identical semantics — no rewrite; the subset rules (selector required, overlaps rejected) apply unchanged. |
