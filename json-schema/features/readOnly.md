# `readOnly`

Source: JSON Schema 2020-12, Validation, §9.4 "A Vocabulary for Basic
Meta-Data Annotations → readOnly and writeOnly".

Marks a value as **managed by the owning authority**: it may appear in a
response but a client should not send it in a request (a server-assigned
`id`, `createdAt`, `etag`). In 2020-12 it is a **pure annotation** — it
never affects validation. **Not supported — rejected at load.** Its only
operational meaning is a **request/response directional asymmetry** that
does not lower into the generator's one-type-per-schema model; in the
Nexus/Temporal setting an operation's request and response are **already
separate types**, so the difference is expressed by modeling them
separately, not by annotating one shared type. This spec owns the shared
rationale its mirror [[writeOnly]] defers to.

## Spec summary

Verbatim (2020-12 validation, §9.4):

> The value of these keywords MUST be a boolean.

> If "readOnly" has a value of boolean true, it indicates that the value
> of the instance is managed exclusively by the owning authority, and
> attempts by an application to modify the value of this property are
> expected to be ignored or rejected by that owning authority.

> These keywords can be used to assist in user interface instance
> generation. … An instance document that is marked as "readOnly" for
> the entire document MAY be ignored if sent to the owning authority, or
> MAY result in an error, at the authority's discretion.

Distilled:
- Value **MUST be a boolean**; default `false`. Multiple applicable
  occurrences OR together (any `true` ⇒ `true`).
- An **annotation**, not an assertion: per spec it **never changes
  whether an instance validates**. A wire value is judged by the schema's
  assertions alone, `readOnly` present or not.
- Its meaning is **directional**: the value belongs on the
  response/read side and should not be sent on the request/write side.
- Paired mirror of [[writeOnly]] (write-side-only). Both describe *which
  direction of the wire a field belongs to*, relative to an owning
  authority.

## Support decision

**Support:** no — **rejected at load time (P6 / P7.1).** Deferred, not a
categorical [[not]]-style exclusion: a request/response-types feature
could admit it later (Open questions).

The defining choices (citing [[PRINCIPLES.md]]):
- **A single type cannot hold a per-direction field (P6).** The
  generator emits **one type per schema**, (de)serialized over the
  **same** fields in both directions (the shared `Validate` flanked by a
  parse and an encode adapter, P12). `readOnly` asks for a field that is
  **present on the way out but absent/ignored on the way in** — two
  distinct wire shapes for one type. There is no coherent single-type
  lowering: the field's presence is not a property of the value, it is a
  property of *which direction the value is crossing*, which the type
  system cannot express on one struct.
- **The two escape hatches both fail the subset.** (a) **Split into
  request and response types** — a real feature (doubles the type
  surface, needs a naming scheme, and interacts with [[ref]]/P15
  collisions and P13 evolution); out of scope for now. (b) **Doc-only
  annotation** — accept `readOnly` but enforce nothing; that is the
  "looks directional, silently isn't" footgun **P10** forbids (a client
  *will* send a `readOnly` field and nothing stops it).
- **The Nexus/Temporal shape makes it redundant anyway (P2).** An
  operation already has **distinct input and output types** ([[services]]).
  The request/response distinction `readOnly` reaches for is therefore
  modeled by putting the field on the **output** type and leaving it off
  the **input** type — the idiomatic, statically-enforced expression of
  the same intent. A shared type annotated `readOnly` is the awkward
  encoding of a distinction the type layer already draws.
- **No assertion to attach (P10).** As a §9.4 annotation it contributes
  no constraint predicate to the shared `Validate` and no adapter check;
  there is nothing to enforce even if we kept it.

Loader behavior:
- Any `readOnly: true` present → **reject** with a fix-it: model the
  read-side field on the operation's **output** type and omit it from the
  **input** type, rather than annotating one shared type.
- `readOnly` value **not a boolean** → **reject** (P7.1; the spec's own
  MUST). `{readOnly: "true"}`, `{readOnly: 1}`.
- `readOnly: false` → **reject** as a **no-op** (it is the default;
  a dead annotation signals author confusion, P7.1). Diagnostic notes it
  has no effect.
- `readOnly` **and** [[writeOnly]] both `true` on one node → **reject**
  (contradictory: managed-by-authority *and* never-returned — the value
  could never legitimately appear in either direction). See [[writeOnly]].

## Type mapping

None — rejected before any type is emitted.

## Validator mapping

None — rejected at load time, so there is no (de)serialize boundary and
no serialize-side behavior (**P12**).

## Property-testing matrix

### Rejected at load time (negative) — the whole surface

| Reason | Example |
|---|---|
| Directional field (no single-type lowering) | `{properties:{id:{type:"string", readOnly:true}}}` (put `id` on the output type only) |
| Value not a boolean | `{readOnly:"true"}`, `{readOnly:1}` |
| No-op (equals default) | `{readOnly:false}` |
| Contradictory pair | `{type:"string", readOnly:true, writeOnly:true}` (see [[writeOnly]]) |

There are no accepted or runtime fixtures: the keyword never reaches code
generation.

## Interactions

- **[[writeOnly]]**: the write-side mirror; defers to this spec for the
  shared directional-asymmetry rationale. Both `true` on one node is a
  contradiction and rejects.
- **[[services]]**: the reason the keyword is redundant here — an
  operation's **input** and **output** are already separate types, which
  is where a read-only vs write-only distinction belongs.
- **[[required]]**: orthogonal in principle (presence vs direction) but
  `readOnly` + `required` is exactly the case single-type modeling
  mangles — required-in-responses yet forbidden-in-requests — which the
  reject sidesteps.
- **[[default]]**: a `readOnly` field with a server-supplied value is the
  archetype; here it is modeled as an output-type field, not an
  annotation on a shared type.
- **[[description]]**: the contrast — an annotation that *is* emittable
  (doc-comment body). `readOnly` has no emittable single-type form.

## Ecosystem variance

| Source dialect | Action |
|---|---|
| JSON Schema 2020-12 | Annotation (§9.4) → reject (directional, no single-type lowering). |
| OpenAPI 3.1 | Adopts 2020-12; `readOnly` native and widely used → reject with the split-types fix-it. OpenAPI's own request/response schema reuse is the pattern this keyword serves — the Nexus model draws that line with separate operation input/output types instead. |
| OpenAPI 3.0 | `readOnly` present with the same semantics → reject. |
| draft-07 | `readOnly` present since draft-07 (annotation) → reject. |

## Open questions

1. **Request/response types.** The clean path to supporting `readOnly` /
   [[writeOnly]] is a feature that derives a **request view** and a
   **response view** from one annotated schema (dropping `readOnly`
   fields from the request, `writeOnly` fields from the response). This
   is a substantial addition (type-surface doubling, naming, P15
   collisions, P13 evolution) and is deferred; until then the reject
   stands, with the separate-input/output-types fix-it as the idiomatic
   workaround.
