# `default`

Source: JSON Schema 2020-12, Validation vocabulary, §9.2
"A Vocabulary for Basic Meta-Data Annotations → default".

Supplies a fallback value for an absent member. In the spec it is a pure
**annotation** — it never affects validation pass/fail. We give it the
**off-the-wire, materialized-on-read** operational semantics: set-ness tracked,
omit-unset on serialize (no deep-equals), materialized **on read** via a
generated `<Field>OrDefault()` accessor in Go, native getters in Java and
Python, and a generated `DEFAULT_<FIELD>` constant in TypeScript.

## Spec summary

Verbatim (2020-12 validation, §9.2):

> There are no restrictions placed on the value of this keyword. When
> multiple occurrences of this keyword are applicable to a single
> sub-instance, implementations SHOULD remove duplicates.

> This keyword can be used to supply a default JSON value associated with
> a particular schema. It is RECOMMENDED that a default value be valid
> against the associated schema.

Distilled:
- An **annotation**, not an assertion: per spec it **never changes
  whether an instance validates**. A value that violates the schema is
  invalid whether or not a `default` is present.
- Supplies the value to use when the member is **absent**.
- The default *should* be valid against the schema (we strengthen this
  to a load-time **MUST** — see Support decision).
- Only meaningful on an **optional** member (a required member is never
  absent, so its default never applies).
- **v1 scope:** scalar values only (`string`/`number`/`integer`/
  `boolean`); object/array/`null` defaults are rejected for now — a
  provisional limit (see Support decision).

## Support decision

**Support:** yes — with **off-the-wire, materialized-on-read** semantics, *not* the literal
"populate on deserialize" reading.

The defining choices (citing [[PRINCIPLES.md]]):
- **Default off-the-wire, materialized on read**: the default is
  **never** written into the field on deserialize and **never** emitted
  on serialize. The generator tracks field *set-ness*; serialize omits
  any unset field with **no value comparison** (never a deep-equals
  against the default). The default is surfaced lazily *on read*. All four
  languages omit an unset defaulted key, so all four preserve wire
  byte-identity (**P1**) — the wire beats ergonomics (**P2**), which is why
  no target bakes the default into the field itself.
- **P9 (absent ≠ zero / set)**: tracking set-ness (not value) is what
  preserves the absent-vs-explicitly-set distinction. Explicitly setting
  a field to a value *equal to* the default marks it set and **pins it
  on the wire** — a deep-equals strip would erase that signal, so we
  don't do one.
- **P12 (serialize-side)**: omit-unset lives in the encode adapter; it is
  the serialize mirror of the parse adapter's "wire-absence → use
  default on read." The shared `Validate` is unaffected — `default`
  contributes **no** constraint predicate (it is not an assertion).
- **Scalar values only, for now (P6/P7.1).** v1 supports `default` only
  when its value is a **scalar primitive** — `string`, `number`,
  `integer`, or `boolean`. An **object** or **array** default is rejected
  at load time, and a `null` default is rejected as degenerate (see
  Loader behavior). The blocker is purely the composite case: a literal
  object/array default would have to be materialized into a constructed
  language value (a populated struct/`record`/dataclass, or a typed
  slice/`List`) on read and woven into the per-field omit-unset machinery
  — a meaningfully harder problem than emitting a scalar literal in
  `<Field>OrDefault()` / a `DEFAULT_X` constant / a getter fallback. **This
  scope limit is provisional and expected to relax** once composite-value
  materialization is specified; it mirrors how
  [[const]] also defers composite values in v1.

Because `default` is an annotation, it has **no runtime validation check
of its own**. At load time its shape is checked here, while each supported
constraint keyword validates the literal against its own rule:

Loader behavior:
- `default` on a **required** member → **reject**. A required member is
  always present, so the default is dead metadata; its presence signals
  author confusion (P7.1). Diagnostic: make the member optional, or drop
  the `default`.
- `default` value **not valid against the member's own schema** →
  **reject**. The spec only *RECOMMENDS* validity; we enforce it (P7.1):
  a default that can never satisfy the field (`{type:"integer",
  minimum:5, default:0}`, `{type:"string", default:42}`) is a schema bug,
  not a runtime concern. Diagnostic names the violated constraint.
  Constraint keywords including `pattern`, `minLength`/`maxLength`,
  numeric bounds, `multipleOf`, `format`, `contentEncoding`, and `enum`
  validate `default` literals in their own loader validators. This is the
  same cross-cutting obligation as [[const]] and [[enum]].
- `default` **and** [[const]] both present → reject (see [[const]]):
  `const` already fixes the value; opposite serialize behavior
  (always-emit vs omit-unset).
- `default` whose value is an **object or array** → **reject** (for now).
  Diagnostic reads "object/array defaults are not yet supported," not
  "forbidden" — the limit is provisional (see Support decision). The member's
  *type* may still be an object/array; it just cannot carry a `default`.
- `default: null` → **reject** as degenerate: on a non-nullable member it
  is invalid against the schema (caught by the validity check above); on a
  nullable member it is a no-op, since absence already surfaces as
  `nil`/`None`/`null`/`undefined` and `<Field>OrDefault()` returning `nil`
  adds nothing. Mirrors [[const]]'s `const: null` rejection.
- Multiple `default` occurrences applicable to one sub-instance (via
  merged schemas) → **last-wins**: identical values dedup per spec; when
  they differ, the value from the **last-merged** schema survives — a
  later [[allOf]] branch, or a `$ref` use-site sibling overriding the
  target (see [[allOf]]/[[ref]]). A differing default is a deterministic
  override, not a conflict; nothing is rejected.

## Type mapping

**None of its own.** `default` does not change the emitted type — the
type comes from [[type]] + [[nullability]], and `default` implies the
member is **optional**, so it takes the optional form (`*T` / `x?: T` /
`T | None` / boxed-or-`@Nullable`). The default value never appears
in the field itself in any target. What `default` *does* add is the
**read-side surfacing mechanism** and the generated default value itself,
which differ per language:

| Language | Set-ness signal (omit-unset) | Read-side surfacing of the default |
|---|---|---|
| Python | private `_<field>: T | None` | **native property** — `@property def field(self) -> T` returns the private value when set and the scalar default otherwise. Its setter accepts `T`; `del model.field` invokes a property deleter that restores unset. Models with defaults receive a generated keyword-only constructor so `Model(field=...)` remains the public construction API. |
| Java | `null` field, omitted by the generated serializer | **generated accessor** — the plain getter preserves the nullable set-ness signal; a separate `get<Field>OrDefault()` returns the field when set and the scalar default otherwise. |
| TypeScript | `undefined` (the `?` field) | **advisory** — interfaces have no methods (PRINCIPLES TS §2), so the generator emits `export const DEFAULT_X = "anon"`. Consumers use `value.x === undefined ? DEFAULT_X : value.x` when `null` must remain distinct; `??` is sufficient only for non-nullable fields. |
| Go | `*T` `nil` + `,omitempty` | **generated accessor** — a `func (m M) <Field>OrDefault() T` returns `*m.Field` when set and the default literal when `nil` (`func (u User) NicknameOrDefault() string { if u.Nickname != nil { return *u.Nickname }; return "anon" }`). The bare field stays `*T` (set-ness intact); the accessor is the materialize-on-read path. Emitted **only** for default-bearing fields. Modeled on proto3's `GetX()` — the same omit-default-on-wire + accessor-materializes-default pattern already familiar to Temporal users. Named `<Field>OrDefault` rather than `Get<Field>` to read as "the value, or its default" and to avoid implying a getter on every field. Alternative approaches considered: (a) advisory constant (`DEFAULT_X` + caller nil-checks) — pushes nil-checks to every call site; (b) populate on deserialize — destroys set-ness, forces deep-equals, breaks P9. |

### Naming and collisions (P15)

The read-side surfacing synthesizes **one new identifier in four targets**
— names absent from the schema, so they can collide:

| Target | Synthesized identifier | Scope | Collision risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| Go | `<Field>OrDefault()` method | struct method-set | a **declared** member whose name maps to `<Field>OrDefault` (Go forbids a field and method of the same name — a **hard compile error**); another `<Field>OrDefault` from a sibling field |
| TypeScript | `DEFAULT_<FIELD>` const | module | another `DEFAULT_<FIELD>` from a field that case-maps the same. [[const]] synthesizes no named *type* in TS (the type closes to an inline literal) but does emit a module-scope `<FIELD>_CONST` binding holding the wire value, which shares this scope — unexported, yet still a redeclaration error if it coincides |
| Python | `_<field>` backing slot | class/member | a declared member overridden to that private identifier; another backing slot after member mapping |
| Java | `get<Field>OrDefault()` method | POJO method namespace | the plain getter of a sibling member named `<field>OrDefault`; another default accessor after member mapping |

The TypeScript constant is named `DEFAULT_<FIELD>`, or
**`DEFAULT_<MODEL>_<FIELD>`** when that member identifier is not unique across
the module's models. Python emits no `DEFAULT_*` binding: its private backing
slot is exactly the emitted member identifier prefixed with `_`.

Per **P15** these participate in the single per-scope collision pass and
**reject at load** on any coincidence — never auto-mangled (a
`NicknameOrDefault2` would renumber under schema evolution, a P13 break).
The rename **escape hatch** is the [[properties]] case-mapping override
(`x-go-name`, …) on the *declaring* field — re-mapping it moves the
synthesized Go `<Field>OrDefault`, Java `get<Field>OrDefault`,
`DEFAULT_<FIELD>`, and `_<field>` names with it,
because all are named off the **emitted** member identifier rather than the JSON
key (`retryCount` + `x-ts-name: attempts` → `DEFAULT_ATTEMPTS`). The
derivation has to work that way for the hatch to open at all: two members
that recase alike collide on `DEFAULT_<FIELD>`, and an override that moved
the members apart while leaving both constants on the JSON-derived name
would reject with a fix-it the author cannot act on — the only remaining
escape being a rename of the JSON property, i.e. a change to the wire
contract (P15, P7.1).

Java materializes-on-read through `get<Field>OrDefault()`; Go does so via the generated
`<Field>OrDefault()` accessor, and Python through a generated property.
TypeScript interfaces have no methods, so TypeScript alone leans on a generated
constant the consumer applies. In every language the
**bare field still carries set-ness** (`nil` / `undefined` / `None` /
`null`); the default is layered on read, never written back into the field,
so omit-on-serialize stays faithful.

## Validator mapping

`default` emits **no validator** — it is an annotation (§9.2), so it
never appears in the shared `Validate` and never causes a runtime
pass/fail. Its operational behavior is entirely in the **adapters**:

- **Parse adapter (deserialize-only):** when the member is absent on the
  wire, leave the set-ness signal "unset" (nil / `undefined` / `None` /
  `null`). Do **not** write the default into the field. Required-presence
  and constraint checks are unaffected (a client sending fewer keys is
  judged on the wire, before any default — this is why
  [[minProperties]]/[[maxProperties]] count *before* default population).
- **Encode adapter (serialize-only), P12:** omit any unset member —
  declaratively, via the per-language set-ness signal above — with **no
  deep-equals**. An explicitly-set member (even to the default value)
  emits.

### Serialize-side (P12)

The whole point of `default` lives here. The encode adapter omits unset
members so the wire stays minimal and the round-trip is faithful: a value
that arrived absent leaves absent, never echoed back as a materialized
default. Mechanisms:

| Language | Omit-unset mechanism |
|---|---|
| Go | the generated `MarshalJSON` builds its raw output map field by field, omitting a nil pointer and emitting a non-nil pointer even when it points to the zero value. |
| TypeScript | `toTransferType` skips keys whose value is `undefined` when building the transfer value (PRINCIPLES TS §4). |
| Python | `to_transfer_type` uses the private backing slot as the emitted value and skips the key when that slot is `None`; constraint checks may read the public property under the same presence guard. |
| Java | the class-level serializer writes the field only when its raw backing value is non-null; the plain getter preserves that raw state and `get<Field>OrDefault()` supplies the read default. |

Three consequences that the count specs already encode:
- A default-filled key is **never on the wire**, so it does not count
  toward [[minProperties]]/[[maxProperties]] in either direction.
- A model that *reads* as fully populated in memory (defaults visible via
  the read-side mechanism) can legitimately serialize **fewer** keys than
  it appears to hold — by design.
- Explicitly setting a member to a value equal to its default **keeps it
  on the wire** (P9). This is the deliberate non-deep-equals behavior.

## Property-testing matrix

### Accepted (positive)

| Shape | Example |
|---|---|
| Optional string default | `{type:"string", default:"anon"}` (member optional) |
| Optional integer default | `{type:"integer", default:0}` |
| Optional boolean default | `{type:"boolean", default:false}` |
| Optional + nullable with scalar default | `{oneOf:[{type:"string"},{type:"null"}], default:"x"}` |
| Differing merged defaults (last-wins) | `allOf:[{default:"a"},{default:"b"}]` → `"b"` (see [[allOf]]). The `$ref`-sibling half — `{$ref:"#/$defs/X", default:"local"}` overriding X's own `default` — is **unreachable today**: a `default` belongs to a scalar, a scalar `$defs` entry is a load reject ([[const]] *Naming and collisions*), and an object/array `default` is rejected on its own. |

### Rejected at load time (negative)

| Reason | Example |
|---|---|
| `default` on a required member | `required:["x"]` with `x:{type:"string", default:"a"}` |
| Default `type`-mismatch (enforced now, P7.1) | `{type:"string", default:42}` |
| Default fails a *constraint* | `{type:"integer", minimum:5, default:0}` |
| **Object default (deferred)** | `{type:"object", properties:{…}, default:{a:1}}` |
| **Array default (deferred)** | `{type:"array", items:{type:"string"}, default:["a"]}` |
| `default: null` (degenerate) | `{oneOf:[{type:"string"},{type:"null"}], default:null}` |
| With `const` | `{type:"string", const:"v1", default:"v1"}` |
| Synthesized-name collision (P15) | a field `nickname` with a `default` **and** a sibling member mapping to `NicknameOrDefault` (Go field/method clash); two `DEFAULT_<FIELD>` consts that case-map the same after qualification (TS); a Python sibling explicitly renamed to `_nickname` (private-backing clash) |

### Runtime fixtures (validator / adapters)

- Member **absent** on the wire → field unset; re-serialize **omits** it
  (no echo). Read surfaces the default per the language mechanism.
- Member **present** with a non-default value → preserved, emitted.
- Member **explicitly set to the default value** → marked set, **emitted**
  (no deep-equals strip). Round-trips as present.
- A default-filled member does **not** count toward
  [[minProperties]]/[[maxProperties]] (cross-checked in those specs).
- `default` never causes a validation failure (annotation): an invalid
  *wire* value still fails its own constraint, default or not.

## Interactions

- **[[required]]**: mutually exclusive in practice — `default` on a
  required member is a load reject (the default can never apply).
- **[[const]]**: mutually exclusive (load reject). Opposite serialize
  behavior: `const` always-emits an auto-populated value; `default`
  omit-unsets. See [[const]].
- **[[nullability]]**: composable. For an optional+nullable member with a
  default, **absence** materializes the default on read while an
  **explicit `null`** pins `null` (faithful in TS via an explicit
  `=== undefined` read; `??` would collapse null;
  Go, Java and Python collapse absent-vs-`null` — see [[nullability]]
  round-trip tiers). The default applies to *absence*, never overriding an
  explicit `null`.
- **[[minProperties]] / [[maxProperties]]**: a default-filled key is
  never on the wire, so the count (taken before default population on the
  way in, over to-be-emitted keys on the way out) excludes it. Already
  documented in both specs.
- **[[type]]**: the default value must be valid for the declared type
  (enforced at load, P7.1). In v1 the default value must additionally be
  a **scalar** (`string`/`number`/`integer`/`boolean`) — a member typed
  `object`/`array` may not carry a `default` yet (see Support decision).
- **[[properties]]**: `default` lives on a member subschema; the
  per-member set-ness machinery is what [[properties]] emits.

## Ecosystem variance

| Source dialect | Action |
|---|---|
| JSON Schema 2020-12 | Native annotation (§9.2). |
| OpenAPI 3.1 | Adopts 2020-12 — `default` native, same semantics. |
| OpenAPI 3.0 | `default` present; same annotation semantics. Native. |
| Swagger 2.0 / draft-4 | `default` present (draft-4+); native. |

`default` is universal across dialects; no rewrite is ever needed. The
only divergence is *our* strengthening of "RECOMMENDED valid" to a
load-time MUST (P7.1), which is stricter than every source dialect — a
schema that ships an out-of-range default is accepted upstream but
rejected here, with a fix-it diagnostic. The owning constraint validators
enforce that MUST; see Loader behavior.
