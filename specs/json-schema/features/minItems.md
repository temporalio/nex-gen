# `minItems`

Source: JSON Schema 2020-12, Validation vocabulary, §6.4.2
"Validation Keywords for Arrays → minItems".

Sets an **inclusive** lower bound on the **number of elements** an array
instance must have. A pure runtime count assertion — no type impact.
Mirror of [[maxItems]]; the shared array-count machinery (portable
element count, per-language primitive, serialize-side re-check,
exact-size pin) is documented once in [[maxItems]] and referenced here.

## Spec summary

Verbatim (2020-12 validation, §6.4.2):

> The value of this keyword MUST be a non-negative integer.

> An array instance is valid against "minItems" if its size is greater
> than, or equal to, the value of this keyword.

> Omitting this keyword has the same behavior as a value of 0.

Distilled:
- Value MUST be a **non-negative integer**.
- Instance valid iff `elementCount(instance) ≥ minItems`.
- "Size" is the portable top-level element count — exactly [[maxItems]]'s
  definition (no unit hazard, unlike the string-length family).
- `minItems: 0` is a **no-op** (spec: same as omitting) — accepted but
  vacuous.
- Applies only to array instances; a `minItems` on a non-array [[type]]
  is rejected at load (**P7.1**).

## Support decision

**Support:** yes — runtime element-count comparison, [[maxItems]] with
`≥`. Same grounding: **P10** (enforced), **P11** (aggregated), **P12**
(shared `Validate` predicate, identical both directions). No effect on
emitted types.

Loader behavior (mirror of [[maxItems]] with `≥`):
- Value not a non-negative integer → reject: non-number, **negative**
  (`minItems:-1`), or **fractional** (`minItems:0.5`). `minItems:2.0`
  accepted (≡ `2`).
- `minItems` on a non-array [[type]] → reject (**P7.1**).
- `minItems` present without `type:"array"` → reject per [[type]]; a
  `type:"array"` still requires [[items]].
- **`minItems:0`** → accepted, treated as **omitted** (the spec's
  explicit equivalence); it constrains nothing. Not rejected as
  "redundant" — it is a spec-sanctioned identity that templated tooling
  emits, so honoring it as a no-op is friendlier than a diagnostic
  (mirrors [[minLength]] `0`).
- **`minItems` > `maxItems` → reject (unsatisfiable)**; `minItems ==
  maxItems` pins an **exact** size (accepted). All combined-size
  satisfiability lives in [[maxItems]].

## Type mapping

None. Constraint lives only in the validator.

## Validator mapping

Per **P10**/**P11**. A single `≥` comparison of the **element count**
against the fixed bound. On deserialize the count is the original wire
array's length even if an element fails [[items]] conversion; on serialize it
is the decoded collection's native length. Same per-language strategy as
[[maxItems]] with `< min` as the failing comparison
(`len(v)` / `v.length` / `len(v)` / `v.size()`).

| Language | Strategy |
|---|---|
| Go | `UnmarshalJSON` checks `len(rawArray) < min` after collecting indexed item violations; serialize checks the typed slice in shared `Validate`. Both collect into one `ValidationError`. |
| TypeScript | After the `Array.isArray` guard ([[items]]), deserialize checks `raw.length < min` after parsing the elements; serialize checks the typed array. A failure pushes ``Violation{path, reason: `must have at least ${min} items, got ${raw.length}`}``. |
| Python | After the `isinstance(raw, list)` guard ([[items]]), the transfer converter checks `len(raw) < min` after parsing the elements; serialize checks the typed list. Both aggregate into the generated `ValidationError`. |
| Java | The per-POJO collecting deserializer (PRINCIPLES Java §5) checks `node.size() < min` after parsing the elements; serialize checks the typed `List<T>`. Both push a structured violation into the single `ValidationException`. Not bean-validation `@Size`. |

Reason strings name the concrete bound and offending count
(`must have at least 2 items, got 1`), per the [[maxProperties]]
count-family convention.

### Serialize-side (P12)

Identical to [[maxItems]]: the predicate re-runs before emit over the
decoded value; an in-memory under-filled slice/list fails serialize
rather than being written. A Go `nil` slice counts as length 0, so a
required non-nullable array with `minItems ≥ 1` and a `nil` in-memory
value fails serialize — the correct, loud outcome (the `nil`-vs-`[]`
encoder decision itself is owned by [[nullability]], see [[items]]).

## Property-testing matrix

### Accepted (positive)

| Shape | Example |
|---|---|
| Inclusive min (non-empty) | `{type:"array", items:{type:string}, minItems:1}` |
| `.0`-valued bound | `{type:"array", items:{type:string}, minItems:2.0}` |
| Zero min (no-op) | `{type:"array", items:{type:string}, minItems:0}` |
| Exact size (min==max) | `{type:"array", items:{type:string}, minItems:2, maxItems:2}` |

### Rejected at load time (negative)

| Reason | Example |
|---|---|
| Value not a number | `minItems:"1"`, `minItems:false` |
| Negative value | `minItems:-1` |
| Fractional value | `minItems:0.5` |
| Type mismatch (P7.1) | `{type:"string", minItems:1}` |
| Unsatisfiable range | `{type:"array", items:{type:string}, minItems:10, maxItems:2}` |

### Runtime fixtures (validator)

- Element count `== min` → OK (`≥` is inclusive).
- Element count `min-1` → one `ValidationError` naming the bound and
  count (`must have at least 2 items, got 1`).
- Empty array `[]` against `minItems:1` → rejected; against `minItems:0`
  → OK.
- Combined with other failing assertions → all reported in one shot
  (**P11**). Serialize of an under-filled in-memory value → rejected
  before emit (**P12**).

## Interactions

- **[[maxItems]]**: the paired upper bound; `minItems > maxItems` load
  error; `minItems == maxItems` pins an exact size (accepted). All
  combined-size satisfiability rules live in [[maxItems]].
- **[[items]]**: orthogonal — `items` types the elements, `minItems`
  requires a floor count. Both apply and aggregate.
- **[[required]]**: distinct axes — `required` is *presence* of the array
  member, `minItems` is *non-emptiness* of its value. `minItems:1` is the
  "non-empty array" idiom and does **not** imply the member is required;
  a member may be optional (absent is fine) yet, when present, be required
  to hold at least one element (**P8**: optional ≠ the value constraint).
- **[[uniqueItems]]**: independent; both apply and aggregate. No
  uniqueness-vs-count satisfiability cross-check — determining whether the
  element type admits enough distinct values to fill a
  `minItems`-with-`uniqueItems` array is undecidable in general and out of
  scope (parallel to the regex-vs-length non-check in [[maxLength]]).
- **[[type]]**: gates applicability; the emitted collection type is
  unchanged.
