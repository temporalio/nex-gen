# `description`

Source: JSON Schema 2020-12, Validation vocabulary, §9.1
"A Vocabulary for Basic Meta-Data Annotations → title and description".

Free-form prose explaining the schema it sits on — the primary human
documentation for a generated type, member, service, or operation. In the
spec it is a **pure annotation** — it never affects validation, and its
text never supplies a *name*. It is not, however, inert on the emitted
shape everywhere: beside a `$ref` it is a merge conjunct, and the merge
materializes a type (see Type mapping). Its single operational role is to
become the **body of the generated doc comment**
(a Go `//` block, a TS JSDoc, a Python class or attribute docstring, a
Java Javadoc). Because it is the primary doc
source, this spec **owns the shared doc-comment machinery** — assembly
order, line-wrapping, and per-language escaping — that its sibling
[[title]] defers to it.

## Spec summary

Verbatim (2020-12 validation, §9.1):

> The value of both of these keywords MUST be a string.

> Both of these keywords can be used to decorate a user interface with
> information about the data produced by this user interface. A "title"
> will preferably be short, whereas a description will provide
> explanation for the purpose of the instance described by this schema.

Distilled:
- An **annotation**, not an assertion: per spec it **never changes
  whether an instance validates**. A wire value is judged by the schema's
  assertions alone, `description` present or not.
- Its value **MUST be a string** (the spec's own MUST).
- **Prose, possibly multi-line** — the spec's own role for it
  ("explanation for the purpose"). Unlike [[title]] (a short label,
  restricted to a single line), a `description` may span paragraphs.
- Applies to **any subschema** — a `$defs` type, a property subschema, an
  array `items` subschema — and, on the Nexus envelope, to **services and
  operations** (see [[services]]).

## Support decision

**Support:** yes — as the **doc-comment body only**. It emits no
validator, no adapter behavior, and no type/field name.

The defining choices (citing [[PRINCIPLES.md]]):
- **Annotation, no runtime effect (P10/P12).** `description` contributes
  **no** constraint predicate to the shared `Validate` and **no**
  parse/encode adapter logic. It is inert at runtime in both directions;
  it touches only the *generated source text*.
- **Never an identifier (P13, P15, P1).** Like [[title]], `description`
  never names a type, field, service, or operation — names come from the
  `$defs` key, the [[properties]] resolved policy, and the [[services]]
  keys. (It can still *cause* a name to be synthesized, beside a `$ref`;
  that name is position-derived — see Type mapping.) Routing prose into
  the identifier namespace would make a cosmetic
  copy-edit a breaking rename (P13), multiply the collision surface (P15),
  and bypass the case-mapping pipeline that keeps names identical across
  languages (P1). (`description` is even less tempting than `title` here —
  no ecosystem generator names types from it — but the rule is the same.)
- **The doc-comment body (P2).** `description` is the prose body of the
  generated doc comment, rendered to read like a comment a human wrote
  (P2). It composes with [[title]] as **summary line + body** (assembly
  order below). Authors' Markdown is passed through **verbatim** (escaped
  only for the comment block); the generator does not render or reinterpret
  it — what the author wrote is what lands in the source (see Ecosystem
  variance). Word-wrapping to the format line length is the one
  transformation applied, and it preserves the author's line breaks,
  paragraph breaks and leading indentation — see *Wrapping* below.

Loader behavior:
- `description` value **not a string** → **reject** (P7.1; and the spec's
  own MUST). `{description: 42}`, `{description: {...}}`, and
  `{description: null}` — an explicit `null` is a non-string *value*, not
  an absent keyword, so it rejects rather than being dropped.
- `description` an **empty or whitespace-only** string → **reject** as
  degenerate: it renders an empty doc body, which is dead metadata and
  signals author confusion (P7.1). Drop it, or give it text.
- `description` containing a **control character** — any code point below
  U+0020 other than line feed and tab, notably U+0000 → **reject**.
  Degenerate metadata in the same class as the empty string, and
  unrepresentable in a comment in at least two targets, so rejecting once
  at load is the only form that keeps the four accept sets identical (P1);
  escaping it four different ways is not. Diagnostic names the offending
  code point.
- `description` as a **sibling of `$ref`** is **not** rejected: a
  sibling-bearing `$ref` is rewritten to an implicit `allOf` and **merged**
  (see [[ref]]), so a use-site `description` folds into the merged schema
  under the [[allOf]] rule below — deduped against the target's own
  `description` when identical, and when they differ the use-site
  `description` **wins** (it is last in the rewrite; see [[ref]]). This is
  the idiomatic way to override a shared type's prose at one use site.
- Multiple `description`s applicable to one node after an [[allOf]] merge
  (P6), whether from an explicit `allOf` or a `$ref` sibling →
  **last-wins**: identical values dedup, and when they differ the
  **last-merged** `description` survives (see [[allOf]]). A differing
  description is a deterministic override, never a reject. Mirrors
  [[title]] and [[default]].

Unlike [[title]], a **multi-line** `description` is **accepted** — prose
is its purpose. Embedded blank lines are preserved as paragraph breaks
(see Doc-comment assembly).

## Type mapping

**None of its own**, and the prose contributes no identifier (rationale in
Support decision). Beside a `$ref` the merge does materialize a type, but
the shape and the name are the merge's, never the prose's (see the P15 note
below). Its own materialization is the **body of the doc comment**, which
carries no type information:

| Placement | Where the body lands |
|---|---|
| `$defs` type | doc comment on the generated **type** (Go `type` / TS `interface` / Python class / Java class) |
| property subschema | doc comment on the generated **field/member** — unless the subschema itself materializes a type (an inline object, or a `$ref` with siblings), in which case the prose travels with that type and the member takes its synthesized fallback line ([[properties]], [[allOf]]) |
| service (envelope) | doc comment on the language-specific service binding defined by [[services]] |
| operation (envelope) | doc comment on the language-specific operation entry defined by [[services]] |
| `items` / other inline subschema | doc comment on the declaration synthesized from that subschema, if any; otherwise dropped (nowhere to attach) |

Per-language block and placement:

| Language | Doc-comment mechanism |
|---|---|
| Go | `// ` line-comment block above the `type`/field/method, **name-led first line** (see below). |
| TypeScript | `/** … */` JSDoc above the `interface`/field. |
| Python | class **docstring** for a type/service; for a **field**, an **attribute docstring** — a bare string literal on the line(s) immediately after the field declaration, which every Python documentation tool and editor picks up. |
| Java | `/** … */` Javadoc above the class/getter/method. |

On an ordinary declaration `description` synthesizes no identifier and has no
P15 surface. **Beside a `$ref` it does**: `description` is not in the inert
sibling class, so the sibling triggers the implicit merge, which materializes a
standalone use-site type and its package-level identifiers ([[ref]],
[[allOf]]). Those names are derived from the **position** — the enclosing type
plus the member — never from the prose. So `description` **does** carry a P15
collision surface at that one position, and a documentation-only edit can change
the emitted namespace and turn a loading schema into a load reject. [[ref]] owns
what that reject must say.

## Doc-comment assembly (shared machinery)

This is the mechanism [[title]] defers to. A generated doc comment is
assembled from up to three parts, in order:

1. **Summary line** — the [[title]], if present.
2. **Body** — the `description`, if present (may be multiple paragraphs).
3. **Tags** — generator-emitted trailers (e.g. an experimental/deprecated
   warning), if any.

Layout rules:
- With **both** a title and a description: summary line, one blank
  comment line, then the body.
- With **only** a description: the body opens the comment (its first line
  becomes the summary in doc tools that treat the first sentence as one —
  Javadoc/JSDoc/PEP 257).
- With **only** a title: just the summary line (see [[title]]).
- With **neither**: Go still emits a comment — see the fallback rule
  below (PRINCIPLES.md, Go §1). TypeScript/Python/Java simply emit none
  (there is no per-language mandate that every declaration carry a doc
  comment in those languages, unlike Go's `golint`-driven convention).
- **Paragraphs** in the body (blank lines in the source string) are
  preserved as blank comment lines.

**Go — the name-led first line.** Idiomatic Go doc comments begin with the
identifier being described (`godoc`/`golint`: `// User is …`). The rule
applies to **every exported declaration the generator emits** — type,
field, method, service binding, operation entry and client — and governs
whatever text **opens** that declaration's comment:
- title present → the summary line is `// <Name> <title>` (see [[title]]).
- title absent, description present → the identifier is prefixed to the
  first line of the description: `// <Name> <first line of description>`.
- **neither present** → the generator supplies a minimal name-led fallback
  line instead of leaving the declaration undocumented (e.g.
  `// <Name> is generated from the corresponding JSON Schema definition.`
  for a type, `// <Name> corresponds to the "<jsonName>" JSON property.`
  for a field). This is a Go-wide mandate, not a `title`/`description`
  behavior — see PRINCIPLES.md, Go §1.
- **Stutter guard:** if that opening text already begins with `<Name>`
  (case-insensitively) **as a whole word**, the identifier is not doubled —
  the text is emitted as-is. Same guard, and the same word-boundary
  requirement, as [[title]].

**Wrapping.** Word-wrapping to the format line length is the **only**
transformation the generator applies to authored prose. Each part is wrapped to
88 columns minus the current indent and the comment prefix width (`// `, ` * `,
docstring indent). Wrapping is **per source line**: an author's explicit line
breaks, paragraph breaks, and each line's **leading indentation** are preserved
— a wrapped continuation repeats the indent and reflows against the reduced
width — so an indented code block stays a code block and a nested list item
stays nested. Runs of interior whitespace are normalized to single spaces; no
other rewriting occurs.

Wrapping must not change what a doc tool *means*. Javadoc reads a `@`-tag as a
block tag only when it opens a line, so a wrap point that lifts an authored
mid-sentence `@`-tag onto its own line converts inert prose into a live tag —
and because the wrap point depends on the enclosing identifier's length and the
declaration's indent, the identical authored string can land inert at one site
and live at another. Our decision: **the wrapper never breaks a line
immediately before a token a target's doc tool treats as positional.**
*(Status: unimplemented — the wrapper is position-blind today.)*

**Escaping.** Each part is escaped so the prose cannot break out of the
comment, break the host language's lexer, or **become a directive the
toolchain acts on**. The three are one obligation, and the table below is
the current spelling of it, not its limit: a host construct not listed here
still has to be neutralized.

| Language | Escaping |
|---|---|
| Go | `//` line comments have no terminator to escape, but they *do* have a **directive grammar**: a physical line whose first token is `+build` is a legacy build constraint and one beginning `go:` is a tool directive, either of which `gofmt` may hoist above the `package` clause. Each physical line is prefixed `// `, and the directive punctuation is backslash-neutralized (`+build` → `\+build`, `go:` → `go\:`) so the text cannot be acted on. Leading whitespace is not a sufficient escape because Go's constraint parser trims it. |
| TypeScript | replace `*/` → `* /` so the body can't close the JSDoc block early. |
| Python | escape `\` → `\\` and `"""` → `\"\"\"` so the body can't terminate the docstring. |
| Java | replace `*/` → `* /`; HTML-escape `&`→`&amp;`, `<`→`&lt;`, `>`→`&gt;`, and `\`→`&#92;` (applied after the `&` pass). The backslash is not cosmetic: JLS §3.3 translates Unicode escapes in a first lexical phase that covers comments, so a `\u` not followed by four hex digits is a hard compile error, and a well-formed one is silently substituted — neither of which any other target does. A Javadoc body is HTML, so the entity renders as the character the author wrote. |

## Validator mapping

`description` emits **no validator** and **no adapter behavior**. It is an
annotation (§9.1): it never appears in the shared `Validate`, never runs in
the parse or encode adapter, and never causes a runtime pass/fail in
either direction. Its entire effect is at generation time, in the emitted
doc comment.

## Property-testing matrix

### Accepted (positive)

| Shape | Example |
|---|---|
| Description on a `$defs` type | `{description:"A registered user account.", type:"object", …}` |
| Description on a property | `properties:{email:{description:"Contact address; used for password resets.", type:"string"}}` |
| Title + description | `{title:"User", description:"A registered user account.", type:"object"}` → summary + body |
| Multi-paragraph description | a `description` with an embedded blank line → two comment paragraphs |
| Description sibling of a `$ref` (merged, last-wins) | `{$ref:"#/$defs/User", description:"Use-site note."}` → the use-site `description` overrides the target's when they differ (see [[ref]]) |
| Differing merged descriptions (last-wins) | `allOf:[{description:"A"},{description:"B"}]` → `"B"` (see [[allOf]]) |
| Description on a service/operation | envelope `services.ChatService.description` → service interface doc comment (see [[services]]) |

### Rejected at load time (negative)

| Reason | Example |
|---|---|
| Non-string value | `{description:42}`, `{description:{...}}`, `{description:null}` |
| Empty / whitespace-only | `{description:""}`, `{description:"   "}` |
| Control character in the prose | a `description` whose text carries U+0000 |

### Runtime fixtures

None. `description` has no runtime behavior — it neither validates nor
(de)serializes. Its only observable output is the generated doc comment,
covered by generation-snapshot tests, not runtime fixtures.

## Interactions

- **[[title]]**: the sibling annotation. `title` is the summary line;
  `description` is the body. This spec owns the shared assembly, wrapping,
  and escaping; [[title]] fills the summary slot.
- **[[properties]]**: owns the field/type naming policy that `description`
  does not participate in. A property's `description` decorates the
  generated member's doc comment; it never renames the member.
- **[[ref]]**: a `description` **sibling** of a `$ref` is not rejected —
  the `$ref` and its siblings are rewritten to an implicit [[allOf]] and
  merged (see [[ref]]); because the rewrite puts the siblings last, a
  use-site `description` **overrides** the referenced target's under the
  last-wins rule below.
- **[[allOf]]**: merges (P6) — explicit or via a `$ref` sibling — can
  bring multiple `description`s onto one node; identical values dedup,
  differing ones resolve **last-wins** (see [[allOf]]), never a reject.
- **[[services]]**: the Nexus envelope decorates services and operations
  with `description` (the envelope's recognized doc member — it uses
  `description`, not `title`); each becomes the doc comment on the
  generated service interface / operation method.
- **[[type]]**, **[[nullability]]**, **[[required]]**: fully orthogonal —
  `description` changes neither the type, its nullability, nor its
  presence.

## Ecosystem variance

| Source dialect | Action |
|---|---|
| JSON Schema 2020-12 | Native annotation (§9.1). Rendered as the doc-comment body. |
| OpenAPI 3.1 | Adopts 2020-12 — `description` native; CommonMark per OAS. |
| OpenAPI 3.0 | `description` present; CommonMark per OAS. |
| Swagger 2.0 / draft-4 | `description` present; same annotation semantics. |

`description` is universal across dialects and needs no rewrite, and —
unlike [[title]] — no generator repurposes it as an identifier, so there
is no naming footgun to guard against.

The one convention to note is **Markdown**: OpenAPI declares `description`
to be CommonMark. We **pass the text through verbatim** into the doc
comment (escaped only for the comment block, and word-wrapped per
*Wrapping*), and do **not** render it to another format or strip the
markup. This is the P2 choice — the author's prose lands in the generated
source as written, which is what a hand-written comment would contain;
downstream doc tooling (godoc, TypeDoc, Sphinx, Javadoc) interprets
whatever markup it supports, **at the position the author wrote it**.

## See also

- [[title]] — the sibling annotation; supplies the summary line that opens
  the doc comment whose body is `description`.
- [[services]] — the Nexus envelope's service/operation `description`s
  become the doc comments on the generated interface and methods.
- [[properties]] — owns the naming policy `description` does not touch.
- [[ref]] — a `description` sibling of a `$ref` merges via the
  implicit-`allOf` rewrite; use-site value wins (last-wins).
- [[default]] — the other basic-metadata annotation (§9.2); unlike
  `description` it carries operational semantics, whereas `description` is
  purely a doc comment.
