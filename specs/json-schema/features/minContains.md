# `minContains`

Source: JSON Schema 2020-12, Validation vocabulary, §6.4.5
"Validation Keywords for Arrays → minContains".

Sets an **inclusive** lower bound on the **number of elements that match
the [[contains]] matcher**. A pure runtime count assertion — no type
impact. Mirror of [[maxContains]] with `≥`; the shared match-counting
machinery (the tally over the matcher predicate, the per-language
primitive, the serialize-side re-check, the exact-count pin) is documented
once in [[maxContains]] and referenced here. `minContains` is the keyword
that **defines the [[contains]] existential floor**: omitting it is the same
as `minContains:1` (the "≥ 1 match" default), and setting it to `0`
**relaxes** the existential entirely.

## Spec summary

Verbatim (2020-12 validation, §6.4.5):

> The value of this keyword MUST be a non-negative integer.

> If "contains" is not present within the same schema object, then this
> keyword has no effect.

> An instance array is valid against "minContains" if the number of
> elements that are valid against the schema for "contains" is greater than,
> or equal to, the value of this keyword.

> A value of 0 is allowed, but is only useful for setting a range of
> occurrences from 0 to the value of "maxContains". A value of 0 causes the
> keyword to always pass validation (but validation can still fail against a
> "maxContains" keyword).

> Omitting this keyword has the same behavior as a value of 1.

Distilled:
- Value MUST be a **non-negative integer**.
- Instance valid iff `matchCount(instance) ≥ minContains`, where
  `matchCount` is the number of elements validating against the
  [[contains]] matcher (the same tally [[maxContains]] documents).
- **Omitting ≡ `1`** — this is exactly [[contains]]' default ≥ 1
  existential.
- **`minContains:0`** turns the existential off: [[contains]] then "always
  passes" and the only remaining teeth come from a paired [[maxContains]]
  (the `0..max` range). Meaningless on its own — see Loader behavior.
- **No effect without [[contains]].** Per **P7.1** a `minContains` with no
  sibling `contains` is a load reject, not a no-op.
- Pure assertion; no annotation behavior, no effect on the emitted
  collection type.

## Support decision

**Support:** yes — a runtime **match-count** comparison, [[maxContains]]
with `≥`, on the same scalar-only envelope [[contains]] draws (scalar
matcher over a scalar [[items]] element type; composite matchers / elements
deferred there and therefore here too). Same grounding: **P10** (enforced),
**P11** (aggregated), **P12** (shared `Validate` predicate, identical both
directions). No effect on emitted types.

Loader behavior (mirror of [[maxContains]] with `≥`, plus the `0` case):
- Value not a non-negative integer → reject: non-number
  (`minContains:"1"`, `minContains:true`), **negative** (`minContains:-1`),
  or **fractional** (`minContains:1.5`). `minContains:2.0` accepted (≡ `2`).
- **`minContains` without [[contains]]** on the same node → **reject**
  (**P7.1**, statically meaningless — the spec's "no effect" tightened to a
  loud error). Diagnostic: add a `contains` matcher or remove `minContains`.
- **`minContains:1`** → accepted; it is the [[contains]] default restated.
  Not rejected as "redundant" — it is a spec-sanctioned identity that
  templated tooling emits, so honoring it is friendlier than a diagnostic
  (mirrors [[minItems]] `0` / [[uniqueItems]] `false`).
- **`minContains:0`** →
  - **with a sibling [[maxContains]]** → **accepted**: the `0..max` range
    (or, with `maxContains:0`, the *must-not-contain* assertion). The
    [[contains]] existence check is relaxed; [[maxContains]] carries the
    teeth.
  - **without [[maxContains]]** → **reject** (**P7.1**): `minContains:0`
    alone makes [[contains]] "always pass" with no upper bound, so the whole
    `contains` block asserts **nothing**. Diagnostic: remove the vacuous
    `contains`, or add a `maxContains`. (Contrast [[minItems]] `0`, which is
    a harmless no-op on a still-meaningful array type; here the *only*
    reason `contains` exists is the assertion `minContains:0` erases.)
- **`minContains` > [[maxContains]] → reject (unsatisfiable)**;
  `minContains == maxContains` pins an **exact** match count (accepted). All
  combined satisfiability for the pair lives in [[maxContains]].
- We do **not** cross-check `minContains` against how many elements *could*
  match the matcher (undecidable in general — parallel to the
  uniqueness-vs-count non-check in [[minItems]]).

## Type mapping

None. Constraint lives only in the validator.

## Validator mapping

Per **P10**/**P11**. A single `≥` comparison of the **match count** against
the fixed bound, identical in both directions (shared `Validate`, **P12**).
Same per-language tally as [[maxContains]] with `< min` as the failing
comparison; a `minContains ≥ 2` (like any [[maxContains]]) **cancels the
[[contains]] short-circuit**, since the exact count is what the bound needs.

| Language | Strategy |
|---|---|
| Go | `n := 0; for _, e := range v { if matchesContains(e) { n++ } }; if n < min { push(Violation{Path, Reason: fmt.Sprintf("too few matching items: at least %d, got %d", min, n)}) }` — a predicate in the shared `Validate`, called by `UnmarshalJSON` after decoding, collected into one `ValidationError`. |
| TypeScript | After the `Array.isArray` guard ([[items]]), ``const n = v.filter(matchesContains).length; if (n < min) push(Violation{path, reason: `too few matching items: at least ${min}, got ${n}`})``, throw one `ValidationError`. |
| Python | A `model_validator` over the decoded `list[T]`: `n = sum(1 for e in v if _matches_contains(e)); if n < min: raise InitErrorDetails(...)`, aggregated into `pydantic.ValidationError`. |
| Java | The per-POJO collecting deserializer (PRINCIPLES Java §5) tallies matches over the `List<T>` and on `n < min` pushes a `Violation{path, "too few matching items: at least " + min + ", got " + n}` into the single `ValidationException`. Not bean-validation. |

Reason strings name the concrete bound and offending match count
(`too few matching items: at least 2, got 1`), per the [[maxContains]]
count-family convention — distinct from [[minItems]]' *total*-count message.
When `minContains` is absent (the default `1`), the failure is [[contains]]'
own existential violation (`no element matches the required schema`), owned
by [[contains]]; an explicit `minContains` produces the count-family
message.

### Serialize-side (P12)

Identical to [[maxContains]]: the predicate re-runs before emit over the
decoded value; an in-memory value with too few matches fails serialize
rather than being written. Real teeth in the statically-typed targets
(Go/TS/Java), where in-memory construction is unchecked. The tally is the
same in memory as on the wire, so the check is the identical `≥` comparison
in both directions.

## Property-testing matrix

### Accepted (positive)

| Shape | Example |
|---|---|
| Match floor ≥ 2 | `{type:"array", items:{type:integer}, contains:{minimum:5}, minContains:2}` |
| `.0`-valued bound | `{type:"array", items:{type:string}, contains:{const:"x"}, minContains:2.0}` |
| Explicit default (≡ contains) | `{type:"array", items:{type:string}, contains:{const:"x"}, minContains:1}` |
| Exact match count (min==max) | `{type:"array", items:{type:string}, contains:{const:"x"}, minContains:2, maxContains:2}` |
| Range 0..max (existential relaxed) | `{type:"array", items:{type:string}, contains:{const:"x"}, minContains:0, maxContains:2}` |

### Rejected at load time (negative)

| Reason | Example |
|---|---|
| Value not a number | `minContains:"1"`, `minContains:true` |
| Negative value | `minContains:-1` |
| Fractional value | `minContains:1.5` |
| No sibling `contains` (P7.1) | `{type:"array", items:{type:string}, minContains:2}` |
| `minContains:0` with no `maxContains` (vacuous) | `{type:"array", items:{type:string}, contains:{const:"x"}, minContains:0}` |
| Unsatisfiable range | `{type:"array", items:{type:string}, contains:{const:"x"}, minContains:3, maxContains:1}` |

### Runtime fixtures (validator)

- Match count `== min` → OK (`≥` is inclusive).
- Match count `min-1` → one `ValidationError` naming the bound and count
  (`too few matching items: at least 2, got 1`).
- Empty array `[]` against `minContains:1` (or the bare [[contains]]
  default) → rejected; against `minContains:0, maxContains:N` → OK (zero
  matches allowed).
- `minContains:0, maxContains:2`: zero, one, or two matching elements → OK;
  three → fail (via [[maxContains]]).
- Combined with other failing assertions ([[maxContains]], [[minItems]] /
  [[maxItems]], a bad element per [[items]]) → **all** reported in one shot
  (**P11**). Serialize of an under-matching in-memory value → rejected
  before emit (**P12**).

## Interactions

- **[[contains]]**: `minContains` **is** the [[contains]] existential floor
  — omitting it ≡ `minContains:1`. It reuses [[contains]]' matcher predicate
  and scalar-only envelope, is a load reject without a sibling `contains`,
  and `minContains:0` relaxes [[contains]] to always-pass (meaningful only
  with [[maxContains]]).
- **[[maxContains]]**: the paired upper bound; owns the shared
  match-counting machinery and all combined satisfiability
  (`minContains > maxContains` reject; `minContains == maxContains` exact
  pin; the `maxContains:0` ⇒ `minContains:0` requirement).
- **[[minItems]] / [[maxItems]]**: bound the **total** element count;
  `minContains` bounds the **matching** subset. Independent — all apply and
  aggregate. A `minContains:2` does not imply `minItems:2` (the two matches
  suffice, but the array's total size is a separate axis).
- **[[items]]**: types every element; `minContains` requires a floor number
  of them to also match the [[contains]] matcher. Supported only when
  `items` is scalar (via [[contains]]).
- **[[type]]**: gates applicability to `type:"array"` (through
  [[contains]]); a mismatch is a load reject (**P7.1**). The emitted
  collection type is unchanged.
- **[[uniqueItems]] / [[required]] / [[nullability]]**: orthogonal, exactly
  as for [[contains]] — element uniqueness, member presence, and member null
  are independent of the match-count floor.
