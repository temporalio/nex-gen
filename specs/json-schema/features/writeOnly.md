# `writeOnly`

Source: JSON Schema 2020-12, Validation, §9.4 "A Vocabulary for Basic
Meta-Data Annotations → readOnly and writeOnly".

Marks a value as **write-side-only**: it may be sent in a request but is
never returned in a response (the archetype is a `password`). In 2020-12
it is a **pure annotation** — it never affects validation. **Not
supported — rejected at load.** It is the mirror of [[readOnly]] and
fails the strict subset for the same reason: its only meaning is a
request/response **directional asymmetry** that does not lower into the
generator's one-type-per-schema model. The shared rationale lives in
[[readOnly]]; this spec states the mirror-case specifics.

## Spec summary

Verbatim (2020-12 validation, §9.4):

> The value of these keywords MUST be a boolean.

> If "writeOnly" has a value of boolean true, it indicates that the value
> is never present when the instance is retrieved from the owning
> authority. It may be sent to the owning authority to set or update the
> value, but it is not returned.

> [E.g.] "writeOnly" would be used to mark a password input field.

Distilled:
- Value **MUST be a boolean**; default `false`. Multiple applicable
  occurrences OR together (any `true` ⇒ `true`).
- An **annotation**, not an assertion: it **never changes whether an
  instance validates**.
- Its meaning is **directional**: the value belongs on the request/write
  side and is absent from the response/read side — the exact mirror of
  [[readOnly]].

## Support decision

**Support:** no — **rejected at load time (P6 / P7.1).** Deferred, not a
categorical exclusion — see [[readOnly]] for the shared reasoning (a
single type cannot hold a per-direction field; the split-types and
doc-only escape hatches both fail the subset; an operation's input and
output are already separate types in the Nexus model).

Mirror-case specifics:
- The canonical case is a **`password`**: present on the operation's
  **input** type, absent from its **output** type. That is exactly how it
  is modeled here — put the field on the input type and leave it off the
  output — rather than annotating one shared type `writeOnly`.
- A **doc-only** acceptance would be worse than for [[readOnly]]:
  a `writeOnly` field silently echoed back in a response is a
  **data-exposure** footgun (a password round-tripped to the client), the
  strongest form of the "looks directional, silently isn't" **P10**
  hazard.

Loader behavior:
- Any `writeOnly: true` present → **reject** with a fix-it: model the
  write-side field on the operation's **input** type and omit it from the
  **output** type.
- `writeOnly` value **not a boolean** → **reject** (P7.1). `{writeOnly:
  "yes"}`, `{writeOnly: 0}`.
- `writeOnly: false` → **reject** as a **no-op** (equals the default).
- `writeOnly` **and** [[readOnly]] both `true` on one node → **reject**
  as contradictory (never sent to the client *and* managed by the
  authority — no direction the value legitimately appears in).

As in [[readOnly]], the four rejects carry four different remedies and must
be distinguishable: `writeOnly: false` is told to delete a dead annotation,
never to split the type by direction.

## Type mapping

None — rejected before any type is emitted.

## Validator mapping

None — rejected at load time, so there is no (de)serialize boundary and
no serialize-side behavior (**P12**).

## Property-testing matrix

### Rejected at load time (negative) — the whole surface

| Reason | Example |
|---|---|
| Directional field (no single-type lowering) | `{properties:{password:{type:"string", writeOnly:true}}}` (put `password` on the input type only) |
| Value not a boolean | `{writeOnly:"yes"}`, `{writeOnly:0}` |
| No-op (equals default) | `{writeOnly:false}` |
| Contradictory pair | `{type:"string", readOnly:true, writeOnly:true}` |

There are no accepted or runtime fixtures: the keyword never reaches code
generation.

## Interactions

- **[[readOnly]]**: the read-side mirror; owns the shared
  directional-asymmetry rationale. Both `true` on one node is a
  contradiction and rejects.
- **[[services]]**: the write-side field belongs on the operation's
  **input** type, which is already distinct from the output type.
- **[[required]]**: `writeOnly` + `required` (a required-on-input,
  absent-on-output field like a `password`) is precisely the case
  single-type modeling mangles; the reject sidesteps it.

## Ecosystem variance

| Source dialect | Action |
|---|---|
| JSON Schema 2020-12 | Annotation (§9.4) → reject (directional, no single-type lowering). |
| OpenAPI 3.1 | Adopts 2020-12; `writeOnly` native (the `password` idiom) → reject with the split-types fix-it. |
| OpenAPI 3.0 | `writeOnly` present with the same semantics → reject. |
| draft-07 | `writeOnly` present since draft-07 (annotation) → reject. |
