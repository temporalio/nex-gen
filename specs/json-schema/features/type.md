# `type`

Source: JSON Schema 2020-12, Validation vocabulary, §6.1.1.

Constrains an instance to one of seven named JSON-Schema type families. The
single most fundamental validation keyword — every other validation keyword
is defined relative to an instance type, so `type` gates whether the rest of
a schema's assertions are meaningful for a given instance.

## Spec summary

- Value MUST be either a string or an array of unique strings.
- Each string MUST be one of: `"null"`, `"boolean"`, `"object"`, `"array"`,
  `"number"`, `"string"`, `"integer"`.
- `"integer"` is **not** a JSON primitive type — it matches any JSON number
  whose fractional part is zero (so `1`, `1.0`, and `1e2` all satisfy
  `type: integer`).
- Array form validates if the instance matches **any** listed type (OR).
- Absence of `type` means "any type" — equivalent to listing all seven.

## Support decision

**Support:** partial — single-string form only.

We accept the single-string form for all seven primitive type names, with
`"null"` admitted only as a [[oneOf]] branch. We
**reject** schemas where `type` is an array. A **leaf** schema — one that
must describe its own shape — with no `type` keyword is also **rejected**;
a typeless schema is legal only when its shape comes from a supported
combinator or reference: a [[oneOf]] (including the nullability
`oneOf:[{type:T},{type:null}]`), an [[allOf]] (merged/flattened at load),
or a [[ref]], where the type is supplied by the branches, the merged
result, or the referenced target respectively.

Rationale (citing [[PRINCIPLES.md]]):
- **P6 (strict subset)**: Multi-type unions don't lower coherently across
  Go/Java; we keep the language ceiling at OpenAPI 3.0's level.
- **P7 / P7.1 (strict schema, reject loudly)**: Array `type` is
  structurally ambiguous (is `["T","null"]` an optional T, a nullable T, or
  a sum type?). Reject at load time with a fix-it message.
- **P8 (optional ≠ nullable)**: The `["T","null"]` idiom collapses two
  different concerns; model nullability through the dedicated
  `oneOf:[{type:T},{type:null}]` convention instead (see [[nullability]]).
- Absent `type` on a **leaf** schema makes its shape undecidable,
  violating **P7** — a [[oneOf]] / [[allOf]] / [[ref]] schema is exempt,
  since its shape is fixed by the branches, the merge, or the reference
  rather than a top-level `type`.

Loader behavior:
- Array `type` → reject with diagnostic naming the schema location and
  pointing at the nullability convention.
- Missing `type` on a **leaf** schema → reject with a diagnostic requiring
  an explicit type. A schema whose shape is supplied by [[oneOf]] /
  [[allOf]] / [[ref]] carries no top-level `type` and is **accepted** — the
  type comes from the branches / merged result / referenced target.
- Unknown type name (`"int"`, `"date"`, etc.) → reject.
- `type: "object"` with no `properties` and no `additionalProperties` →
  reject (P7.1). Per spec this is "any object",
  but the typed-codegen contract requires explicit intent. Diagnostic
  names the three resolutions: add `properties: {...}` (typed struct),
  add `additionalProperties: true` (open opaque map), or add
  `additionalProperties: false` (closed empty object).
- `type: "null"` standalone (outside any [[oneOf]]) →
  reject. A field that is *always* `null` carries no information and
  is almost always a schema bug. A legitimate `{"type":"null"}` appears as
  a branch of a [[oneOf]]: in the two-branch form it is [[nullability]], and
  among 3+ kinds it is a nullable sum type.
- **Literal-kind compatibility is directional.** A numeric literal supplied
  by [[const]] / [[enum]] / [[default]] inhabits `number` whatever its
  fractional part, but inhabits `integer` **only when it is integral**.
  `{"type":"integer", "const":1.5}`, `{"type":"integer", "enum":[1,1.5]}`
  and `{"type":"integer", "default":1.5}` are rejects;
  `{"type":"number", "const":1}` is accepted. `integer` ⊂ `number` and never
  the converse, so a compatibility test that admits either kind against the
  other is wrong in one direction. The rule is about the literal and the kind,
  not about how the two met, so it governs a literal that reaches the node
  through an [[allOf]] merge exactly as it governs one authored on the node —
  see [[allOf]], which applies it to a merged kind.
- **The `±(2^53−1)` integer cap binds at load, not only at runtime.** A
  literal or bound that puts an `integer` position's accepted set wholly
  outside the cap empties it, and an empty accepted set is a reject:
  `{"type":"integer", "const":9007199254740992}` and
  `{"type":"integer", "minimum":9007199254740992}` both reject. A bound in
  the *redundant* direction (a `maximum` above `+(2^53−1)`) is dead range
  and stays allowed — see [[maximum]].
- **Every reject listed here applies at every position a schema node can
  occupy** — a property, an [[items]] schema, a [[oneOf]] branch, a typed
  [[additionalProperties]], a [[contains]] matcher, and a `$defs` bucket
  authored on any of those. A `$defs` entry is held to the same rules
  wherever its bucket sits; there is no position in which a subschema is
  carried through unvalidated.

## Type mapping

Emitted field type when `type` appears in a field-producing position.
Optional/nullable wrapping is owned by [[required]] and [[nullability]] —
this table is the bare type only.

Required form below. Optional fields wrap per [[nullability]] (Java
boxes to `Long`/`Double`/`Boolean`; Go uses `*T`; TS uses `?` on the
field; Python uses `T | None`).

| `type` token | Go | TypeScript | Python | Java |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `"string"`  | `string`            | `string`             | `str`             | `String` |
| `"integer"` | `int64`             | `number`             | `int`             | `long` |
| `"number"`  | `float64`           | `number`             | `float`           | `double` |
| `"boolean"` | `bool`              | `boolean`            | `bool`            | `boolean` |
| `"object"`  | struct from [[properties]] | interface from [[properties]] (**not classes**); a free-form `oneOf` object branch stays `Record<string, unknown>` | `@dataclasses.dataclass` from [[properties]]; inline object shapes are hoisted and named, while a free-form `oneOf` object branch stays `dict[str, typing.Any]` | POJO class (Java 8; **not records** — see PRINCIPLES Java §1) |
| `"array"`   | `[]T` (T from [[items]])   | `T[]`                | `list[T]`         | `List<T>` |
| `"null"`    | only as a [[oneOf]] branch † | only as a [[oneOf]] branch † | only as a [[oneOf]] branch † | only as a [[oneOf]] branch † |

† Two branches is the [[nullability]] pattern; among three or more kinds it
is a nullable sum type. Standalone `type: "null"` — outside a `oneOf` — is a
reject.


Notes:
- **TS**: `integer` and `number` collapse to `number`; integer-ness moves
  to the validator.
- **Java**: `long`/`double`/`boolean` for required fields; `Long`/
  `Double`/`Boolean` for optional fields (see [[nullability]]). The
  primitive-vs-boxed split is what the JVM gives us for free; reference
  types like `String`/`List<T>` use a non-null validator instead.
- **Python**: `bool <: int`, so every generated integer/number check
  excludes `bool` explicitly — `True` is not `1` on the wire (see the
  validator mapping).
- **Number range and identity**: `number` is the finite IEEE-754 binary64
  domain shared by all four targets. A numeric token whose correctly rounded
  value overflows to infinity (for example `1e400`) is rejected. Accepted
  numbers round-trip by mathematical value, not source spelling: `5`, `5.0`,
  and `5e0` are equivalent, as are positive and negative zero. Each target may
  use its idiomatic JSON serializer; Java therefore continues to emit an
  integral `double` with its normal `.0` spelling.
- **The binary64 domain is a *declared domain*, and `type` owns it.** It is
  **P1** exception (c): the accepted value set is narrowed, so a decimal token
  that is not exactly representable is admitted as its **nearest finite
  binary64 value** and a token outside the domain is **rejected** — both
  identically in all four targets. Declared once here and enforced uniformly
  everywhere, it is a **P6** subset decision, not a per-target capability
  floor: it is not "the least capable target's range", and a target whose
  native numeric type is *wider* (Python's unbounded `int`) narrows to the
  declared domain rather than keeping the extra precision. The `±(2^53−1)`
  `integer` range is the same kind of decision and stands on the same clause.
  Two things the licence does **not** cover: **validation semantics are never
  excepted**, so a value outside the domain must be refused everywhere rather
  than accepted in one target; and a value outside the domain must be refused
  *loudly and at the right stage* — silently emitting it, or letting a
  satisfiability check that cannot see the domain pass it, is a defect, not a
  bounded loss.
- **A `number` node's carrier never depends on a literal's spelling.** An
  integral [[const]] / [[enum]] / [[default]] on a `number` node still lowers to
  the target's binary64 carrier (`float64` / `number` / `float` / `double`),
  never to the `integer` carrier. Only the node's declared `type` — or, for a
  [[nullability]] wrapper, the non-null branch's — selects the carrier.

## Validator mapping

Per **P10** validation is enforced at the (de)serializer boundary. Per **P11**
errors aggregate into the language-native primitive.

| `type` token | Go | TypeScript | Python | Java |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `"string"`  | typed `Unmarshal` into `string` | `typeof v === 'string'` | `isinstance(v, str)` | Jackson typed binding |
| `"integer"` | raw-map `*json.RawMessage` → runtime `parseSpecInteger` → `int64` (accepts `1.0`, rejects `1.5`, caps ±(2^53−1)) | `typeof v === 'number' && Number.isSafeInteger(v)` (accepts `1.0` natively; caps ±(2^53−1)) | runtime `_parse_spec_integer(v, path, violations)` → `int` (accepts `1.0`, rejects `1.5` and `bool`, caps ±(2^53−1)) | node helper `SpecNumbers.specLong(node, path, errs)` called by the collecting deserializer (accepts `1.0`, rejects `1.5`, caps ±(2^53−1)) |
| `"number"`  | finite `float64` parse | `typeof v === 'number' && Number.isFinite(v)` | numeric, non-`bool`, and finite-binary64 check, narrowed through `_binary64` | node helper `SpecNumbers.specDouble(node, path, errs)` (numeric and finite) |
| `"boolean"` | `bool` unmarshal | `typeof v === 'boolean'` | `isinstance(v, bool)` (rejects `1`/`0`) | `Boolean` binding |
| `"object"`  | typed struct unmarshal | `typeof v === 'object' && v !== null && !Array.isArray(v)` | `isinstance(v, dict)`, then the branch/member converter builds the dataclass | typed class binding |
| `"array"`   | typed slice unmarshal | `Array.isArray(v)` | `isinstance(v, list)` | typed `List` binding |
| `"null"`    | `raw == nil` / `isNull(*raw)` | `v === null` | `v is None` | `v == null` |

Strategy per language:
- **Go**: Every generated struct gets a custom `UnmarshalJSON`. It decodes
  the object into `map[string]json.RawMessage` and uses per-key raw-message
  pointers to preserve absence (P9), dispatches per field, builds
  `Violation{Path, Reason}` and collects them into a single non-retryable
  Temporal `ApplicationError` with type `PayloadValidationError` and
  `[]Violation` as its first detail.
  Integer fields go through a runtime helper that also enforces the
  cross-language integer cap (`±(2^53−1)`):
  ```go
  // integerCap = 1<<53 - 1 = 9007199254740991 (== JS Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER)
  func parseSpecInteger(n json.Number) (int64, error) {
      // Pseudocode: the emitted helper classifies n.String() directly,
      // normalizes sign/exponent, rejects non-zero fractional digits, compares
      // digit strings against integerCap, then converts the proven-safe token.
      // It never rounds through Float64 before testing integer-ness.
      // ...exact token algorithm...
  }
  ```
  User-facing field stays plain `int64`. The Go primitive holds ±2^63,
  but the validator rejects anything past the ±(2^53−1) cap so all four
  languages agree on the accepted range.
- **TypeScript**: Hand-emit `typeof`/`Array.isArray` checks per field; no
  runtime schema library (P4). `Number.isInteger(v)` is spec-compliant
  for type-classification (`1.0 === 1` in JS, so
  `Number.isInteger(1.0) === true`) — verified empirically across all
  10 type-classification fixtures. Push `Violation { path, reason }`
  into a list, then throw one non-retryable Temporal `ApplicationFailure` with
  type `PayloadValidationError` and the `Violation[]` as its first detail.
  Integer fields emit `typeof v === 'number' && Number.isSafeInteger(v)`.
  `JSON.parse` silently rounds integers past 2^53 to the nearest double,
  and with the cap at `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` (`2^53−1`) that post-parse
  check is sound **for magnitude**: every integer literal past the cap
  rounds to a double that fails `Number.isSafeInteger` (e.g.
  `9007199254740993` → `9007199254740992`, which is `> MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`
  → rejected), so no text pre-scan and no `lossless-json` (P4) is needed
  to enforce the cap.
  It is **not** a complete fractional-part check. A post-parse predicate
  cannot see a fractional digit that the parse already dropped. The effect is
  systematic for literals in `[2^52, 2^53)`, where the double spacing is `1`, so
  `JSON.parse("9007199254740991.1") === 9007199254740991` and
  `Number.isSafeInteger` reports `true`. It can also occur at smaller
  magnitudes when a sufficiently fine fractional part rounds away (for example,
  `JSON.parse("1.00000000000000001") === 1`). See the parse-boundary note
  under the large-integer fixtures below for which targets share this
  limitation.
- **Python**: models are inert dataclasses (**PRINCIPLES Python §1**), so
  every type-classification check is a hand-emitted `isinstance` call in the
  model's `_<Model>TransferTypeConverter` (**PRINCIPLES Python §3**), each
  mismatch appending a `Violation { path, reason }` to the list the converter
  raises as one non-retryable Temporal `ApplicationError` with type
  `PayloadValidationError` (**PRINCIPLES Python §2**). Because `bool`
  is a subclass of `int`, an integer or number check **must exclude `bool`
  explicitly** — otherwise `True` classifies as `1`. A classified `number` is
  **narrowed to binary64** in both directions, through the generated runtime's
  `_binary64(value)`: an integral `5` is stored as `5.0`, the `float` its member
  is annotated. Python is the one target whose `int` is unbounded, so keeping the
  wire `int` let a `number` past 2^53 hold its exact value here while Go,
  TypeScript and Java rounded it into their `float64`/`number`/`double` — the
  same payload reading back as a *different* number, which P1 forbids (the
  binary64 domain is shared by all four targets, not a Python-side choice). The
  re-emitted lexeme changes with it (`5` → `5.0`), which P1 does not constrain —
  a number's spelling is not part of JSON identity. `_binary64` returns its
  argument unchanged on `OverflowError` rather than raising: a magnitude past the
  binary64 range has nothing to narrow to, and the finiteness check has already
  recorded that violation and will raise it with the others (P11). Integer fields
  stay a plain `int` and run through the generated runtime's
  `_parse_spec_integer(value, path, violations)`: it rejects `bool`, accepts
  an `int`, accepts a `float` with zero fractional part (`1.0`, `1e2`), and
  rejects a fractional one (`1.5`) — the same accept/reject set as Go's
  `parseSpecInteger` and Java's `SpecNumbers.specLong`, reached by the same
  mechanism: like the Java helper it **pushes a `Violation` and returns
  `None`** rather than raising, so one bad integer never aborts the rest of
  the object's checks (**P11**). Python ints are unbounded, so the helper
  also enforces the cross-language cap `±(2^53−1)`:
  `abs(v) > 9007199254740991` → reject. The accepted *values* are identical
  in all four targets; the `reason` **text** for a rejected number is not —
  Python follows TypeScript, collapsing both the fractional and the
  over-cap failure into `expected integer`, where Go names them separately
  (`not an integer` / the cap message).
- **Java**: POJOs (Java 8 floor; not records, see PRINCIPLES Java §1)
  bound by the per-POJO collecting deserializer (Java §5) — **no**
  per-field `@JsonDeserialize`, no `Long`/`Double` binding. It calls node-based
  runtime helpers per numeric field; `SpecNumbers.specDouble` rejects a
  non-number or a token such as `1e400` whose `doubleValue()` is not finite,
  while `specLong` additionally enforces integer semantics. Each helper takes the field's
  `JsonNode`, and on a bad value **pushes a `Violation` and returns
  `null`** (it never throws, so aggregation stays a clean list-append):
  ```java
  // SpecNumbers.specLong — CAP = 9007199254740991L (2^53-1).
  static Long specLong(JsonNode n, String path, List<Violation> errs) {
      if (!n.isNumber()) {                        // rejects "1", true, etc.
          errs.add(new Violation(path, "expected integer"));  return null;
      }
      if (!isFiniteNode(n)) {                     // co-emitted helper; `1e400`
          errs.add(new Violation(path, "not an integer"));     return null;
      }
      BigDecimal d = n.decimalValue();            // exact; no double rounding
      if (d.stripTrailingZeros().scale() > 0) {   // "1.0"/"1e2" ok, "1.5" rejected
          errs.add(new Violation(path, "not an integer"));    return null;
      }
      if (d.abs().compareTo(BigDecimal.valueOf(CAP)) > 0) {   // ±(2^53-1) cap
          errs.add(new Violation(path, "exceeds cap"));       return null;
      }
      return d.longValueExact();
  }
  ```
  Rationale (empirically verified, Jackson 2.18): Jackson's defaults
  *silently truncate* `1.5`→`1` for `Long` fields — a P7 violation
  blocking shipping with defaults. `ACCEPT_FLOAT_AS_INT=false` fixes
  truncation but rejects spec-valid `1.0`/`1e2` and still coerces `"1"`.
  The custom helper is the only path that matches the spec. The body
  printed above is **normative**, including its finiteness guard and use of
  `n.decimalValue()`: a finite `BigDecimal` built from the token is exact, so
  `4503599627370496.5` rejects, whereas the `n.doubleValue()` shortcut
  would round it to an integer first and accept it.
  The `±(2^53−1)` cap is enforced explicitly above, before Java's own
  `longValueExact()` conversion. **Reading from a `JsonNode`
  (not a live parser) is what lets a spec-strict failure become a
  `Violation{path,reason}` instead of a bind-aborting
  `MismatchedInputException`** — the helper is called from the two-stage
  collecting deserializer (PRINCIPLES Java §4/§5), the exact parallel of
  Go's `parseSpecInteger` and Python's `_parse_spec_integer`. The
  alternative — retaining a `JsonDeserializer<Long>` and driving it over
  a sub-parser — makes identical decisions but re-introduces a per-field
  throw/catch and a sub-parser allocation, so it was rejected.

### Serialize-side (P12)

On the way out the value is already decoded, so the wire-classification
work (the `1.0`-vs-`1.5` parse, token typing) does **not** re-run — it
lives only in the parse adapter. What the shared `Validate` re-checks
before emit:

- **`integer` cap.** The in-memory `int64`/`long`/`int`/`number` is
  re-checked against `±(2^53−1)`; a value constructed past the cap is a
  `PayloadValidationError` application failure, not silently emitted. Go `int64` / Java `long` hold
  magnitudes the cap forbids, and Python ints are unbounded, so this
  check has real teeth on the out-path.
- **`number` finiteness.** Every target rejects `NaN` and `±Infinity`
  before emit with `must be a finite number`; the check applies recursively
  to properties, union branches, array elements (at every depth), and typed-map
  members. The runtimes otherwise disagree (`JSON.stringify` produces `null`,
  Go's encoder returns an unstructured error, and Python/Jackson may emit a
  non-JSON extension), so delegating to the encoder would violate P1/P11.
  TypeScript uses `Number.isFinite`; Go uses `math.IsNaN`/`math.IsInf`; Python
  uses an exact comparison against the binary64 finite range (which also safely
  handles unbounded integers); Java uses `Double.isFinite`. Integer validation
  keeps its existing cap/integrality checks and is necessarily finite already.

`object`/`array`/`string`/`boolean` carry no extra serialize check
beyond structural recursion into nested `Validate` and the
omit/emit-`null` rules owned by [[nullability]].

## Property-testing matrix

### Accepted values (positive tests)

| Shape | Values |
|---|---|
| Single primitive | `"boolean"`, `"object"`, `"array"`, `"number"`, `"string"`, `"integer"` |
| Typeless via combinator/reference | `{"oneOf":[{"type":"string"},{"type":"null"}]}`, `{"allOf":[…]}`, `{"$ref":"#/$defs/X"}` — shape from the branches / merge / target (see [[oneOf]] / [[allOf]] / [[ref]]) |

### Rejected at load time (negative tests)

Loader must produce a clear, located diagnostic for each.

| Reason | Values |
|---|---|
| Array form (P6/P7) | `["string","null"]`, `["integer","number"]`, full 7-element union, `[]`, `["string"]` |
| Absent `type` on a **leaf** schema (P7) | `{}`, `{"description":"…"}` (no `oneOf`/`allOf`/`$ref` to supply the shape) |
| Object without shape (P7.1) | `{"type":"object"}` with no `properties` and no `additionalProperties` (spec says "any object"; we require explicit intent). [[patternProperties]] does not supply a shape — it is rejected unconditionally. |
| `"null"` standalone | `{"type":"null"}` anywhere except as a branch of a [[oneOf]] |
| Unknown type name | `"int"`, `"float"`, `"date"`, `"any"`, `"bigint"`, `"String"`, `"INTEGER"` |
| Wrong outer type | `5`, `null`, `true`, `{"type":"string"}` |
| Nested / malformed | `[["string"]]` |
| Object shape keyword on `type: "array"` (P7.1) | `{"type":"array", "properties":{…}}`, `{"type":"array", "additionalProperties":false}` — never accepted-and-ignored. The mirror (`items` on `type: "object"`) is [[items]]'. |
| Fractional literal on `integer` (directional rule) | `{"type":"integer","const":1.5}`, `{"type":"integer","enum":[1,1.5]}`, `{"type":"integer","default":1.5}` |
| `integer` accepted set emptied by the cap | `{"type":"integer","const":9007199254740992}`, `{"type":"integer","minimum":9007199254740992}` |
| Sibling on a `oneOf` node | `{"oneOf":[…], "type":"object"}`, `{"oneOf":[…], "properties":{…}}`, `{"oneOf":[…], "additionalProperties":false}` (see [[oneOf]]) |

Each row is also owed a negative test at a **nested** position — inside
[[items]], inside a [[oneOf]] branch, and inside a `$defs` bucket authored on a
non-model node — since the reject is positional-invariant.

### Runtime fixtures per accepted type (validator tests)

For each accepted `type`, fuzz over:
- **Canonical accept**: `"x"`, `1`, `1.5`, `true`/`false`, `{}`, `[]`, `null`.
- **Boundary accept**: `""`, `0`, `-0`, `1.0` (must satisfy `integer`), `1e2`.
- **Wrong-type reject**: every other primitive against this type — 7×6=42
  cross-reject cases.
- **`bool`-is-not-`integer` trap**: `true` against `"integer"` must reject
  in all four languages. Go/TS/Java reject naturally (`true` is not a
  number token); Python relies on the explicit `isinstance(v, bool)`
  reject inside `_parse_spec_integer`.
- **Large integers (cap = ±(2^53−1))**: each language's helper
  (`parseSpecInteger`, `_parse_spec_integer`, `SpecNumbers.specLong`,
  and TS's `Number.isSafeInteger` use) must pass an identical fixture
  set: accept `1`, `1.0`, `1e2`, `-0`, and the cap boundary
  `±(2^53−1)`; reject `1.5`, `true`/`false`, `"1"`, non-numeric
  strings, NaN, ±Infinity, and any magnitude past `±(2^53−1)`.
  Specific boundary values: accept `9007199254740991` (`2^53−1`) and
  `-9007199254740991`; reject `9007199254740992` (`2^53`),
  `9007199254740993` (`2^53+1`, which TS silently rounds to `2^53` —
  must still reject), and `18014398509481985` (`2^54+1`). Same
  accept/reject set in all four languages.
- **Fractional literals rounded to integral binary64 values.** The normative rule
  is the one stated at the top of this spec: `integer` matches a JSON
  number whose **written** fractional part is zero, so
  `1.00000000000000001`, `4503599627370496.5`, and
  `9007199254740991.1` reject. Enforcing it requires reading the literal's
  decimal text, which only two targets
  can: Go's helper takes a `json.Number` (the verbatim token) and Java's
  takes a `JsonNode` it converts with `decimalValue()`. TypeScript and
  Python are handed a value the platform parser already produced — the
  double nearest the literal — and when that double is an integer within
  the safe-integer cap, `Number.isSafeInteger` / `float.is_integer()` report
  a whole number and the field is accepted. The divergence therefore applies
  to **any non-integral decimal token that rounds to an integral binary64 value
  within the cap**. The `[2^52, 2^53)` band makes the effect systematic because
  every binary64 value there is integral, but sufficiently fine fractional
  parts can round away at smaller magnitudes too.

  **Status: open.** This is a four-target *accept-set* divergence, and **P1**
  licenses none — the binary64 domain restriction above narrows the accepted
  set identically everywhere, whereas this splits it: Go and Java reject where
  TypeScript and Python accept. It is a known hole, not a sanctioned loss, and
  the conformance suite carries it as a tolerated divergence rather than as
  intended behavior. Closing it means giving the two parse-boundary targets the
  decimal text (the byte boundary sits outside the converter — PRINCIPLES
  TypeScript §4, Python §3, the same root cause as the untyped-extras precision
  note in [[additionalProperties]]); it never means loosening Go and Java to
  match, which would be the artificial common-denominator floor P1 forbids.

## Interactions

- **Gates which assertions apply.** Spec §3.4 silently ignores
  type-mismatched keywords; per **P7.1** we instead **reject** mismatched
  combinations at generator time (e.g. `{type:"string", minimum: 5}`
  errors).
- **[[const]]**: per **P13.1**, the emitted field type is **closed** to
  the const value — a literal / defined type / value class over `type`'s
  primitive mapping. A bump is a deliberate breaking change to the value
  contract, surfaced loudly.
- **[[enum]]**: the value set derives from `type`; per **P13.1** the
  emitted type is **closed** to the known values and an unrecognized value
  is rejected on deserialize.
- **[[oneOf]]**: a supported union is one whose branches occupy
  pairwise-disjoint JSON type kinds — each branch's `type` supplies the
  kind that is the wire selector. `type:"null"` may appear as a branch:
  as one of exactly two (the [[nullability]] pattern) it makes the field
  nullable; a `null` branch among 3+ kinds is a nullable union ([[oneOf]]).
  `integer`+`number` branches together are rejected (unsatisfiable
  overlap). Two further rules this spec owns:
  - **A union node carries no `type`, and a `type` sibling on it is a
    reject**, not a hint — as are `properties` and `additionalProperties`
    ([[oneOf]] states the general sibling rule).
  - **The guards above apply to the keywords a node itself carries, and a
    `oneOf` beside them does not disarm either one.** A union node may
    legitimately carry *no* `type` — that is the typeless-schema exemption in
    the Support decision, where the shape comes from the branches. What the
    exemption does not do is excuse a `type`, `properties` or
    `additionalProperties` the author *did* write on that node from the rules
    this spec applies to it everywhere else. So a shapeless
    `{"type":"object"}` is refused beside a `oneOf` exactly as it is refused
    bare and as a `oneOf` **branch**. Adding a keyword must never *widen*
    what loads; a keyword that is itself ignored and also suppresses an
    unrelated reject is the compounded form of the silent-acceptance P7.1
    forbids.
  - **Discriminator distinctness is decided by value, never by
    representation.** Where [[oneOf]] requires the branches'
    discriminator [[const]]s to be pairwise-distinct, two numeric literals
    are distinct only if they denote **different numbers**. `1` and `1.0`
    are the same number (the identity rule above), so branches tagged
    `const: 1` and `const: 1.0` are *not* distinct and the union rejects.
    This is the same equality the emitted dispatch uses — it selects a
    branch by numeric value, so a distinctness test that compared JSON
    spellings would admit a union whose second branch no dispatch can ever
    reach.
- **[[properties]] / [[items]]**: only meaningful when `type` is `"object"`
  / `"array"`. Cross-product mismatches are generator-time errors.
  Object-shape decisions live in [[properties]] / [[additionalProperties]];
  in summary, **typed structs are open by default** (per JSON Schema
  spec and **P13** — accept and preserve extras into a catch-all),
  closed behavior requires explicit `additionalProperties: false`.
- **[[format]]**: supplies no type of its own — a materialized temporal
  replaces the field's `string` with a native construct. The applicability
  gate is **not** this spec's: that a `format` on a non-string `type` is a
  load reject (**P7.1**) is specified and tested in [[format]].
- **[[required]]** + [[nullability]] own optional/nullable wrapping;
  `type` only contributes the inner type.

## Ecosystem variance

| Source dialect | Action |
|---|---|
| JSON Schema 2020-12 | Native. Reject only documented out-of-subset cases. |
| OpenAPI 3.1         | Aligns with 2020-12. Native. |
| OpenAPI 3.0         | Human porting guidance: rewrite `nullable: true` as canonical `oneOf:[{T},{null}]` ([[nullability]]). OpenAPI 3.0 documents are not a separate accepted input dialect. |
| Swagger 2.0 / draft-4 | Human porting guidance: rewrite nullable forms during conversion to 2020-12; a declared older `$schema` rejects at the document dialect gate. |

Pre-draft-4 union-of-schemas form (`type: [{...},{...}]`) is irrelevant —
no current toolchain emits it.
