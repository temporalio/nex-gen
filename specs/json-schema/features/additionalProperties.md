# `additionalProperties`

Source: JSON Schema 2020-12, Core (Applicator vocabulary),
§10.3.2.3 "Keywords for Applying Subschemas to Objects →
additionalProperties".

Controls instance members **not** matched by [[properties]] or
[[patternProperties]]. This is where the generator's **open-vs-closed
struct** decision lands.

## Spec summary

Verbatim (2020-12 core, Applicator):

> The value of "additionalProperties" MUST be a valid JSON Schema.

> The behavior of this keyword depends on the presence and annotation
> results of "properties" and "patternProperties" within the same schema
> object. Validation with "additionalProperties" applies only to the
> child values of instance names that do not appear in the annotation
> results of either "properties" or "patternProperties".

> For all such properties, validation succeeds if the child instance
> validates against the "additionalProperties" schema.

> The annotation result of this keyword is the set of instance property
> names validated by this keyword's subschema. This annotation affects
> the behavior of "unevaluatedProperties" in the Unevaluated vocabulary.

> Omitting this keyword has the same assertion behavior as an empty
> schema.

Distilled:
- Applies only to members **not** matched by [[properties]] /
  [[patternProperties]].
- The value is a full subschema — `false` (nothing additional allowed),
  `true`/`{}` (anything allowed), or a typed schema (additional members
  must match it).
- **Omitting it = empty schema = everything additional allowed** → the
  spec default is **open**.

## Support decision

**Support:** partial.

The binding decision:

> **Typed structs are OPEN by default.** Per the JSON Schema spec
> default (omitted `additionalProperties` = empty schema = allow
> anything) and **P13** (forward compatibility: accept and preserve
> unknown fields), a `{type:object, properties:{...}}` with no
> `additionalProperties` emits an **untyped catch-all** that preserves
> and round-trips unmatched members. Closed behavior requires an
> explicit `additionalProperties: false`.

Accepted forms and their meaning:

| Form | With `properties` (struct) | Without `properties` (map) |
|---|---|---|
| **omitted** | open struct + untyped catch-all (the default) | **rejected** by [[type]] (`type:object` with no shape) |
| **`false`** | closed struct (extras rejected) | closed empty object (any member rejected) |
| **`true`** | open struct + untyped catch-all | open opaque map |
| **`{type:T}`** (supported subschema) | **supported** — typed catch-all (`T`-valued extras) | typed map (`T`-valued) |
| **`{}`** (empty-schema spelling) | **rejected** per **P7** | **rejected** per **P7** |

Rationale (citing [[PRINCIPLES.md]]):
- **P13 (forward compat)**: open-by-default preserves unknown members so
  a producer adding a field never breaks an older consumer. Verified the
  preserve+round-trip behavior per language (see Validator mapping).
- **P7 (strict schema)**: `additionalProperties: {}` is the empty-schema
  spelling of `true` — ambiguous, so **rejected**; diagnostic says "use
  `true` for an open object." (Matches PRINCIPLES P7's
  `additionalProperties: {}` → reject.)
- **Typed `additionalProperties` is supported in every position**,
  including *alongside* `properties`. The key that makes it lower
  coherently is the **named-field representation** below: the typed
  catch-all is a dedicated `additionalProperties` member, never an inline
  index signature, so the TS index-signature conformance problem
  (`[k:string]: T` forcing every declared property to be a subtype of
  `T`) never arises.
- The extras schema must be a **supported subschema** (`{type:T}` with a
  recognized shape). `additionalProperties:{type:object}` with no shape
  is rejected per **P7.1**, same as anywhere else.
- The extras schema may be a [[oneOf]] **sum type**. Like an array element it
  is named after its position at load — `<EnclosingType>Value` — moved into
  `$defs`, and the extras schema rewritten to a `$ref`, so the member type is
  an ordinary named union in every target ([[oneOf]] §"Unions in element
  positions"). Go and Java decode each member through the union's dispatcher,
  keyed violations included; a whole-map decode cannot allocate a sealed
  interface.

### Catch-all representation: always a named field

The catch-all is emitted as a **dedicated named member in all four
languages** — never an inline open map — *even with no `properties`*. A
pure map (`{type:object, additionalProperties:{type:T}}`) emits the same
named aggregate it would carry with properties, holding the map in the
catch-all member:

- **Go** — struct with `AdditionalProperties map[string]T`, **not** a
  bare `map[string]T`.
- **Java** — class with `Map<String,T> additionalProperties`, **not** a
  top-level `Map<String,T>`.
- **Python** — a dataclass with an `additional_properties: dict[str, V] =
  dataclasses.field(default_factory=dict)` member, **not** a `dict[str,T]`
  alias.
- **TypeScript** — an `interface` with an `additionalProperties:
  Record<string,T>` member, **not** an inline index signature or a bare
  `Record<string,T>` alias.

This buys two things:

1. **Shape stability** (**P2**/**P13**): adding `properties` later only
   *adds fields/attributes* to the same type — it never changes kind
   ("map alias" → "struct/model"), so downstream call sites keep
   compiling. The Python instability this avoids: a `dict[str,T]` alias
   that becomes a dataclass breaks `m["k"]` with `TypeError: not
   subscriptable`.
2. **A clean separation of declared keys from extra keys.** Declared
   members are renamed to canonical language identifiers (the
   identifier case-mapping in [[properties]]); extra keys are
   arbitrary and must be preserved **verbatim**. Keeping extras in their
   own `additionalProperties` member (rather than mingled with declared
   members via a TS index signature or a flat map) keeps the two
   namespaces unambiguous — the canonicalizer touches declared members
   only, extras pass through untouched.

Shape stability is also why an object written **inline** in a value position —
a property, an array element, a map member — is *named after that position and
hoisted into `$defs`* rather than lowered to a bare map at the use site (see
[[properties]] §"Naming an inline object shape"). It is the same aggregate
either way, so `{type:object, additionalProperties:true}` written on a property
and a `$ref` at an authored definition of that shape emit identical code, and
adding `properties` to the inline form later still only adds fields. The one
position where a free-form object stays inline is a [[oneOf]] branch, where it
is the union's object *kind* rather than a position of its own.

For TS specifically, the named member also sidesteps the index-signature
conformance limit: a *typed* index signature (`[k: string]: T`) is
illegal alongside heterogeneous declared props (TS2411 — a declared
`id: number` is not assignable to a `string` index type, verified
`/tmp/ts_flatten.ts`), whereas a named `additionalProperties:
Record<string,T>` member has no such constraint and stays fully typed.

The wire form is unchanged in all cases — extras are always top-level
JSON members; the in-memory catch-all is bridged by the generated
(de)serializer (Go custom `(Un)MarshalJSON`, Java the per-POJO collecting
`@JsonDeserialize`/`@JsonSerialize` — which routes undeclared tree keys
into the catch-all map and spreads them back on write, **not**
`@JsonAnySetter`/`@JsonAnyGetter` (a class-level custom (de)serializer
bypasses those), TS hand-emitted ser/deser that lifts top-level extras
into `additionalProperties` and spreads them back out, Python the
generated transfer type converter doing the same for
`additional_properties`).

## Type mapping

All four languages emit the named catch-all member when extras are
allowed (see representation note above). The catch-all element type is
`T` for `{type:T}`, else the raw type (`json.RawMessage` / `unknown` /
`Any` / `JsonNode`) so untyped extras survive a round-trip without the
generator guessing their shape (**P13**).

| Case | Go | TypeScript | Python | Java |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Open struct, untyped extras (default / `true`) | struct + `AdditionalProperties map[string]json.RawMessage` | `interface` + `additionalProperties: Record<string, unknown>` | dataclass + `additional_properties: dict[str, typing.Any]`, populated/emitted by the converter (Python §3) | POJO + `Map<String,JsonNode>`, populated/emitted by the collecting (de)serializer (Java §5) |
| **Typed extras + `properties` (`{type:T}`)** | struct + `AdditionalProperties map[string]T` | `interface` + `additionalProperties: Record<string, T>` | dataclass + `additional_properties: dict[str, T]`, populated/emitted by the converter (Python §3) with per-extra `T` validation | POJO + `Map<String,T>`, populated/emitted by the collecting (de)serializer (Java §5) with per-extra `T` validation |
| Closed struct (`false`) | no catch-all field; unknown → error | exact `interface`, no `additionalProperties`; unknown → error | no catch-all member; the converter flags each undeclared key as a `Violation` | no catch-all field; the collecting deserializer (Java §5) flags each undeclared tree key as a `Violation` |
| Open opaque map (`true`, no props) | struct + `AdditionalProperties map[string]json.RawMessage` (wrapper) | `interface` + `additionalProperties: Record<string, unknown>` (wrapper) | dataclass + `additional_properties: dict[str, typing.Any]` (wrapper) | class + `Map<String,JsonNode> additionalProperties` (wrapper) |
| Typed map (`{type:T}`, no props) | struct + `AdditionalProperties map[string]T` (wrapper) | `interface` + `additionalProperties: Record<string, T>` (wrapper) | dataclass + `additional_properties: dict[str, T]` (wrapper) + per-extra `T` validation | class + `Map<String,T> additionalProperties` (wrapper) |
| Closed empty object (`false`, no props) | empty `struct{}`; any member → error | empty `interface`; any member → error | empty dataclass; the converter flags any key as a `Violation` | empty POJO; the collecting deserializer (Java §5) flags any tree key as a `Violation` |

The TS `additionalProperties` member and the Python
`additional_properties` field are always present when extras are allowed
(empty when none were received — Python via
`dataclasses.field(default_factory=dict)`), so the surface is uniform
whether or not a given instance carried extras.

A declared [[properties]] member literally named `additionalProperties`
collides with the generated catch-all member in **all four languages** —
**Go** (`AdditionalProperties`), **Java** (`additionalProperties`), **TS**
(`additionalProperties`), **Python** (`additional_properties`) → reject at
load time with a diagnostic.

### Why `json.RawMessage`, not `any`, for Go untyped extras

The Go untyped element type is `json.RawMessage` (raw JSON),
**not** `any` (`map[string]interface{}`). This is load-bearing for
**P13** — `any` corrupts the very data the catch-all exists to preserve,
because `encoding/json` decodes **every JSON number to `float64`**.
Empirically, the same opaque object round-trips as:

```
any : {"big":9007199254740992,"keep":{"a":1,"b":2},"price":1,"sci":100}
raw : {"big":9007199254740993,"keep":{"b":2,"a":1},"price":1.0,"sci":1e2}
```

With `any`:
- **silent precision loss** — `9007199254740993` → `…992` (the same
  `>2^53` float64 hazard as the [[type]] integer cap, but on data we
  never modeled, so we can't even detect it);
- number reformatting and object-member reordering are observable text
  changes but preserve JSON identity under **P1**.

`json.RawMessage` preserves the decoded JSON value, including number
precision and the authored number lexeme. `encoding/json` may still compact
whitespace, HTML-escape characters, and reorder the outer map. It also makes
on-demand typed decode clean (`json.Unmarshal(extra["foo"], &T)`) and
reuses the same `*json.RawMessage` shadow machinery the custom
`UnmarshalJSON` already uses for declared fields — `any` would introduce
a second, lossy representation. The only cost is that a value must be
`Unmarshal`'d before use, which is acceptable for a preserve-and-pass-
through role.

Python `Any` and Java `JsonNode` don't share the `float64` hazard: the
`json` module decodes an integer literal to an arbitrary-precision `int`,
and the generated exact-tree reader hands the untyped member a `JsonNode`
holding the exact token — Jackson's own tree builder folds every floating token
into a `double`, which is why that reader exists — so both re-emit
`9007199254740993` unchanged and neither needs an
equivalent workaround.

### TypeScript untyped extras: a bounded exception to P13.2

TS `unknown` **does** share the hazard, and — unlike Go — cannot be
worked around. **PRINCIPLES TypeScript §4** places the byte boundary
*outside* the converter: the Temporal converter owns
`JSON.parse`/`JSON.stringify` and hands `fromTransferType` an
already-parsed value. By the time any generated code runs,
`9007199254740993` is already the `number` `9007199254740992` — there is
no surviving representation to preserve and no interception point. The
only fixes would be for the converter to own the parse step (a
`JSON.parse` reviver, or parsing from the raw text itself), which moves
the boundary §4 defines and breaks the composable transfer-value
contract that lets a parent's `toTransferType` embed its children's
results.

So **P13.2's "preserved verbatim" holds for TypeScript with one stated
exception**: an undeclared numeric value outside IEEE-754 double range
round-trips to the nearest double. Object keys, strings, booleans, `null`,
nested structure and every number representable as a double are preserved.
Object-member **order** is neither guaranteed nor part of JSON identity under
**P1**. An author whose payload carries integers past
2^53 must not rely on the catch-all to ferry them; note that *declaring*
the field does not rescue the value either — the cross-language integer
cap is `±(2^53−1)` and a literal past it is a validation reject, not a
silent round ([[type]]). Carrying such a value across a TypeScript
target requires modeling it as a `string`.

## Validator mapping

Per **P10**/**P11**: extras are handled at the boundary and any closed-mode
violation aggregates. Every violation below sits at the offending extra's path,
**rendered per P11.2** — an extra key is arbitrary text, so the spelling belongs
to that clause and is not restated per target here.

| Language | Open, untyped (preserve) | Open, typed `{type:T}` | Closed (reject extras) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Go | `UnmarshalJSON` routes unmatched keys into `AdditionalProperties`; `MarshalJSON` re-emits them | same routing, but each value goes through `T`'s runtime helper; failures → a `Violation` at the extra's path | `UnmarshalJSON` emits a `Violation` at the extra's path with `Reason:"unknown field"` per unmatched key, collected into one `PayloadValidationError` application failure |
| TypeScript | deser lifts non-declared keys into the `additionalProperties` Record; reser spreads them back to top-level | same, but each value validated as `T` before going into `additionalProperties` (member stays fully typed `Record<string,T>`) | check parsed keys against the known set; push one `Violation` per extra, throw one `PayloadValidationError` application failure |
| Python | `from_transfer_type` lifts non-declared keys into the `additional_properties` dict verbatim; `to_transfer_type` spreads them back to top-level | same, but each value is validated and materialized as `T` before going into `additional_properties` (member stays fully typed `dict[str, T]`) | check parsed keys against the declared set; append one `Violation` with `reason="unknown field"` per extra, raise one `PayloadValidationError` application failure |
| Java | the per-POJO collecting deserializer (Java §5) routes parsed-tree keys not in the declared set into the `additionalProperties` map; the matching serializer spreads them back | same routing, but each extra value is validated as `T` (bad keys → a `Violation` at the extra's path) | the collecting deserializer pushes one `Violation` with `"unknown field"` per undeclared tree key into the single `PayloadValidationError` application failure — no fail-fast `ignoreUnknown=false`/`UnrecognizedPropertyException` |

### Per-member `T` validation

"Validated as `T`" is literal and symmetric: a member is held to **everything**
its declared type declares — the spec-strict integer parse and the integer cap,
numeric bounds and `multipleOf`, string length / `pattern` / `format`, a
materialized temporal or `contentEncoding` construct, array `minItems` /
`maxItems` / `uniqueItems` / `contains`, a `const`/`enum` value set, and a
referenced model's or union's own validation — with the **member's key as the
violation path** (`labels.env`, `entries.a.street`), and in **both directions**
(**P12**): a catch-all mutated to an invalid value fails serialization rather
than reaching the wire.

Per language, the mechanism is the one that position already uses:

- **Go / TypeScript / Java** run the same check emitters a *property* of that
  type runs, over the decoded member inside the member loop — one set of
  predicates, two call sites.
- **Python** validates and **materializes** each member inside the converter's
  member loop, calling the same `_parse_*` / `_check_*` helpers (or the
  referenced model's own converter) a *property* of that type calls, then
  re-encoding each member through the matching `_format_*` / serialize path
  on the way out. So `additional_properties` holds the *declared* member
  type — an `Inner` instance, an `int` parsed from `1.0`, a `datetime`,
  `bytes` — rather
  than the raw wire value.
- A **closed member value set** (`const`/`enum`) is a validator-only closedness
  in Go and Java: a member has no field to hang a defined type or value class
  off, so the admissible set is checked against wire literals instead. The
  accepted value set is identical in all four languages (TypeScript and Python
  additionally close the *type*, as `Record<string, "a" | "b">` /
  `Literal["a","b"]`).

A member may be **nullable** — `additionalProperties` is the [[nullability]]
`oneOf` — in which case an explicit `null` is *kept as a null member* rather than
dropped from the map or rejected: Go `map[string]*T`, Java
`Map<String, @Nullable T>`, TypeScript `Record<string, T | null>`, Python
`T | None`. A present member still carries its own constraints.

Wrapping the extras schema in the [[nullability]] wrapper does not change what
the schema requires of the emitter: every package-level compiled-regex static
the member's own assertions need is still emitted, and a nullable array is still
`[]T` — including as a typed `additionalProperties` value — so the element
traversal ranges over the value, never over `*value`.

### Serialize-side (P12)

The catch-all is re-emitted by spreading its members back to top-level
JSON (Go `MarshalJSON` / TS reserializer / Java the per-POJO collecting
serializer, Java §5 / Python `to_transfer_type`). Symmetry per mode:

- **Open, untyped** — extras pass through **verbatim**; Go's
  `json.RawMessage` element type carries the decoded JSON value out again with
  its number precision and lexeme intact (no `float64` degradation — the same
  hazard as on decode, see "Why `json.RawMessage`, not `any`" above).
- **Open, typed `{type:T}`** — each extra value is re-validated through
  `T`'s shared checks before emit, so a catch-all mutated to an invalid
  value fails serialization rather than emitting bad data.
- **Closed (`false`)** — no catch-all exists in memory, so there is
  nothing extra to emit; the closed shape is preserved by construction.

Declared members serialize under their original wire names
([[properties]] case-mapping is reversed on the way out); extras keep
their verbatim keys — the named-catch-all split keeps the two namespaces
unambiguous in both directions.

**The lift and the spread are key-preserving.** Every key the wire object owns
and `properties` does not match appears in the catch-all, and every catch-all
key appears back on the wire — an extra key is arbitrary data, not an
identifier. **P13.2(b)**'s verbatim rule carries exactly one exception, the
numeric one stated above for TypeScript; that exception is about a member's
*value* and reaches no key, so no key may be dropped or renamed under it. In
TypeScript the accumulator is therefore written and read by a mechanism the
prototype chain cannot intercept: a key named `__proto__` is an own member of
the parsed object and must stay one through the copy, rather than reassigning
the accumulator's prototype and vanishing. Dropping a key is not only a
fidelity loss — the key set is what [[minProperties]] / [[maxProperties]] count
at each boundary, so a non-key-preserving copy also makes the two counts
disagree, and validation semantics are never excepted (**P1**).

**Violation paths for extra keys.** An extra key is the one path segment this
subset lets a *payload* choose, and it may contain the characters the path
grammar itself uses. It is therefore rendered per **P11.2** rather than spliced
in raw; the grammar, its escaping and the current cross-target gap all belong to
that clause.

## Property-testing matrix

### Accepted (positive)

| Shape | Example |
|---|---|
| Open struct (default) | `{type:object, properties:{id:{type:integer}}}` |
| Closed struct | `{type:object, properties:{id:{type:integer}}, additionalProperties:false}` |
| Open struct (explicit) | `…, additionalProperties:true` |
| Open opaque map | `{type:object, additionalProperties:true}` |
| Typed map | `{type:object, additionalProperties:{type:string}}` |
| **Typed extras + `properties`** | `{type:object, properties:{id:{type:integer}}, additionalProperties:{type:string}}` |
| Closed empty object | `{type:object, additionalProperties:false}` |
| Any of the above written **inline** on a property / element / map member | named after its position and hoisted ([[properties]]); emits identically to the `$defs` + `$ref` form |

### Rejected at load time (negative)

| Reason | Example |
|---|---|
| Empty-schema spelling (P7) | `additionalProperties: {}` (use `true`) |
| Non-schema value | `additionalProperties: "yes"`, `…: 1` |
| Out-of-subset extras schema (P7.1) | `additionalProperties:{type:object}` with no shape |
| Catch-all name collision | `{properties:{additionalProperties:{type:string}}, additionalProperties:{type:integer}}` (declared member collides with the generated field) |

### Runtime fixtures (validator)

- Open struct + extra key → preserved, present on re-serialize.
- Open struct or map + a hostile extra key (`""`, `"0"`, `"a-b"`, `"toString"`,
  `"constructor"`, `"__proto__"` — object- and string-valued) → every key
  preserved and re-emitted, in all four targets; the same key set is what the
  count keywords see at both boundaries.
- Closed struct + extra key → one `Violation` per extra, aggregated with
  declared-field errors into a single `PayloadValidationError` application
  failure.
- Typed map / typed extras + value of wrong type → rejected with
  `path = key`; multiple bad extras reported in one shot (P11).
- Typed map + a member violating a *constraint* of its type (a string under
  `minLength`, an integer off its `multipleOf`, an array under `minItems`, a
  value outside a `const`/`enum` set) → rejected with `path = key`, on both
  deserialize and serialize.
- Nullable member (`additionalProperties: {oneOf:[{T},{"type":"null"}]}`) +
  an explicit `null` → accepted and preserved as a null member; a present
  member still validates against `T`.
- Typed extras + good value → validated and round-trips.
- Open opaque map round-trips arbitrary nested JSON unchanged.
- Pure map (all four languages) decodes into the wrapper's catch-all
  (`AdditionalProperties` member / `additionalProperties` Record /
  `additional_properties` dict), not a bare map/dict.

## Interactions

- **[[properties]] / [[patternProperties]]**: `additionalProperties`
  only sees members **not** in their matched-name annotations (spec
  §10.3.2.3). [[patternProperties]] is **temporarily unsupported**
  (rejected at load time in v1), so in our subset only [[properties]]
  matches are excluded — every other member is "additional."
- **[[unevaluatedProperties]]**: strictly more powerful (sees the
  transitive evaluated set across applicators). We **reject**
  `unevaluatedProperties` per **P6** (its annotation-dependent semantics
  don't lower); `additionalProperties` is the supported subset.
- **[[type]]**: `additionalProperties: true|false` is one of the three
  explicit resolutions [[type]] requires for `{type:object}` with no
  `properties`.
- **[[minProperties]] / [[maxProperties]]**: count constraints apply to
  the full member set including preserved extras, and to the same key set at
  both boundaries. Closing the object caps that set at the declared count; the
  count keywords own the resulting satisfiability check.
- **[[required]]**: a closed struct still permits required members; it
  only forbids *unknown* ones.
- **[[oneOf]]**: `additionalProperties: true` with no `properties` — the
  free-form object — is the one object shape a `oneOf` branch can carry
  **inline** without a type name: it declares nothing to emit, so TypeScript
  and Python express it structurally (`Record<string, unknown>` /
  `dict[str, Any]`) and Go and Java wrap it as the union's `<Union>Object`
  variant, in the map-shaped form from the table above. Any *structured*
  inline branch is named and emitted as an ordinary model instead.

## Ecosystem variance
