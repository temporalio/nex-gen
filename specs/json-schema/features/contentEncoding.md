# `contentEncoding`

Source: JSON Schema 2020-12, Validation, §8.3 "A Vocabulary for the
Contents of String-Encoded Data → contentEncoding".

Declares that a JSON **string** carries binary data encoded with a named
scheme (`base64`, `base64url`, `quoted-printable`, …). In 2020-12 the
content keywords are **annotations by default** — they do not assert. We
adopt the two byte-transform encodings — **`base64`** (standard
alphabet) and **`base64url`** (URL-safe alphabet, RFC 4648 §5) — and
**materialize both into a native bytes type** (Go `[]byte`, Java
`byte[]`, Python `bytes`, TS `Uint8Array`), differing only in the wire
codec the adapter selects. Every other encoding is rejected at load.
This mirrors [[format]]'s posture exactly: adopt a curated,
provably-portable subset, own the check and the canonical serializer
rather than delegating to a native decoder, and reject the rest.

## Spec summary

Verbatim (2020-12 validation, §8.3):

> If the instance value is a string, this property defines that the
> string SHOULD be interpreted as encoded binary data and decoded using
> the encoding named by this property.

> The value of this property MUST be a string.

And the vocabulary-wide annotation rule (§8.2):

> [The content keywords] function as annotations. … Implementations MAY
> … decode … but … MUST NOT … automatically … Instead … [offer] an
> opt-in.

Distilled:
- Value **MUST be a string** naming an encoding (`base64`, `base64url`,
  `base16`, `quoted-printable`, `7bit`, `8bit`, `binary`).
- Applies only to a **string** instance; on any other type it is a
  no-op per the spec.
- **Annotation by default** — like [[format]]'s `format-annotation`, it
  does not validate unless an implementation opts in. We opt into
  assertion + materialization for `base64` / `base64url`.
- Describes a string that is *really* binary: the JSON payload is the
  encoded text, the modeled value is the decoded bytes.

## Support decision

**Support:** partial — **`base64` and `base64url`, materialized to a
native bytes type.** Every other encoding is **rejected at load**
(deferred, *not* a categorical [[not]]-style **P6** exclusion).

The defining choices (citing [[PRINCIPLES.md]]):
- **Both encodings lower to the same bytes type, identically (P1).**
  Each declared encoding has **one deterministic canonical wire form**
  that every language emits byte-identically — the **P1** line — and
  both decode into the same native bytes value. Go / Java / Python get
  it from a standard **and** a URL-safe stdlib codec (Go
  `base64.StdEncoding` / `base64.RawURLEncoding`, Java
  `Base64.getEncoder()` / `getUrlEncoder().withoutPadding()`, Python
  `base64.b64encode` / `urlsafe_b64encode`); TS has no
  browser-portable stdlib codec, so it gets a small generator-owned
  pure-JS codec (below). We already own the parse/encode adapters
  (PRINCIPLES: shadow-layout `UnmarshalJSON`, the collecting Jackson
  (de)serializer, the TS and Python transfer type converters), so
  selecting the standard vs URL-safe codec per node is a codec choice, not
  new machinery.
- **A native bytes field is the idiomatic shape (P2).** A base64 blob
  modeled as a bare `string` forces every consumer to decode by hand at
  each use site; `[]byte` / `byte[]` / `bytes` / `Uint8Array` is what a
  human would have written. This is the same materialization tradeoff
  [[format]] makes for temporals — pay conversion cost for the idiomatic
  field.
- **No new dependency, browser-safe (P4).** Go / Java / Python use only
  their stdlib base64 (Go `encoding/base64`, Java `java.util.Base64`,
  Python `base64`); TS uses a small **emitted pure-JS codec** — **no
  `Buffer` and no `atob`/`btoa`** — so the generated TS runs unchanged in
  the browser as well as Node. No runtime schema library, consistent with
  the hand-emitted-validator ethos.
- **Own the check, don't delegate (P1/P10).** As with [[format]], the
  validity check is a **generator-owned** pinned regex over the wire
  string (inside the [[pattern]] RE2-safe subset) rather than a decoder's
  own error behavior — several base64 decoders are *lenient* (Python
  `b64decode` without `validate=True` silently drops non-alphabet bytes;
  a naive hand-rolled decoder would skip them too), which would let
  malformed input through differently per language and break **P1**. The
  regex is the oracle; the decoder runs only after it passes.

**`base64` is padded, `base64url` is unpadded** — each has a single
**strict canonical form** (no lenient variants accepted). `base64` uses
the standard `+`/`/` alphabet with required `=` padding; `base64url` uses
the URL-safe `-`/`_` alphabet with **no** padding (the RFC 4648 §5 form
used by JWT/JWS and emitted by Go's `RawURLEncoding`). The two encodings
materialize to the **same** bytes
type and differ only in the wire codec; the declared `contentEncoding`
picks it. Because only the canonical form is accepted, the wire
round-trips byte-identically with no re-canonicalization step.

**Every non-base64 encoding is rejected.** `quoted-printable`, `7bit`,
`8bit`, `binary`, and `base16` have no portable bytes lowering
(`7bit`/`8bit`/`binary` are not even transformations — they assert the
*string itself* is already the content) and would be
accepted-but-unenforced metadata, the exact "looks constrained, silently
isn't" footgun **P10** forbids. Reject with a fix-it.

Loader behavior:
- `contentEncoding` value **not a string** → **reject** (P7.1; the spec's
  own MUST). `{contentEncoding: 5}`, `{contentEncoding: ["base64"]}`.
- `contentEncoding` on a **non-string** [[type]]
  (`{type:"integer", contentEncoding:"base64"}`) → **reject** (P7.1):
  the spec makes it a vacuous no-op; a statically meaningless keyword is
  a load reject here, exactly as [[format]] / [[pattern]] treat a type
  mismatch.
- Any encoding other than `base64` / `base64url` (`quoted-printable`,
  `7bit`, `8bit`, `binary`, `base16`, unknown) → **reject** with a fix-it
  listing the supported values.
- `contentMediaType` / `contentSchema` present on the same node →
  **reject**, owned by [[contentMediaType]] / [[contentSchema]] (a
  base64 blob *labeled* with a media type has nowhere to emit the label
  in the model; the reject there wins over materialization here).
- A supplied [[const]] / [[default]] / [[enum]] string literal must be
  valid for the declared encoding (checked at load, P7.1) and is stored /
  echoed in its **canonical** form.

## Type mapping

The encoded string is materialized to the language-native **bytes**
type; the wire stays a JSON string. Both encodings share the type and
differ only in the canonical wire form.

| Go | Java | Python | TS | Canonical wire (identical in all targets) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `[]byte` | `byte[]` | `bytes` | `Uint8Array` | `base64`: padded standard alphabet (RFC 4648 §4); `base64url`: unpadded URL-safe alphabet (RFC 4648 §5); no line breaks either way |

The four adapters call the stdlib codec **explicitly** (we own the
adapters; we do not rely on any native `[]byte`/`byte[]` default
binding), choosing the standard or URL-safe variant per the declared
`contentEncoding`:

| Language | `base64` codec | `base64url` codec |
|---|---|---|
| Go | `base64.StdEncoding` | `base64.RawURLEncoding` |
| Java | `Base64.getDecoder()` / `Base64.getEncoder()` | `Base64.getUrlDecoder()` / `Base64.getUrlEncoder().withoutPadding()` |
| Python | `base64.b64decode(s, validate=True)` / `b64encode` | `urlsafe_b64decode(s + pad)` / `urlsafe_b64encode(b).rstrip(b"=")` |
| TS | generator-owned `b64ToBytes(s)` / `bytesToB64(v)` | generator-owned `b64urlToBytes(s)` / `bytesToB64url(v)` — same pure-JS codec, URL-safe alphabet, no padding |

- **TS** — field `Uint8Array` (the idiomatic binary type in both the
  browser and Node). No native bytes-in-JSON, so the codec is a
  **generator-owned pure-JS base64/base64url codec** — a lookup table +
  plain arithmetic over the `Uint8Array`, emitted **once** as a shared
  runtime helper (the compile-once analog). It uses **no `Buffer` and no
  `atob`/`btoa`**, so the generated TS runs unchanged in the browser
  (P4). *(Keeping a canonical `string` in TS — the [[format]]-style
  fallback used for `date`/`duration` — is the alternative in Open
  questions.)*
- **Python** — the codec is generator-owned, living in the
  `_parse_base64` / `_parse_base64url` / `_format_base64` /
  `_format_base64url` runtime helpers rather than in a library bytes type,
  for the same reason [[format]] owns its temporal parsing: full control of
  the accept/reject line and the canonical output. `urlsafe_b64decode`
  requires padding, so the unpadded wire is re-padded before decode
  (`s + "=" * (-len(s) % 4)`).

**No member-derived identifier, no P15 surface.** Unlike [[default]]'s
`<Field>OrDefault()` accessor, bytes materialization renames nothing and the
field is simply typed as bytes. A target may share a generator-owned compiled
predicate by encoding kind; that declaration is independent of authored member
and derived-position names, so two members cannot collide through it.

## Validator mapping

Per **P10** / **P11**. The check is a single predicate over the wire
**string**, run in the **parse adapter** (that is where the encoded text
is still observable): the pinned regex for the declared encoding,
compiled **once** ([[pattern]]'s machinery — ASCII-class rule and
per-target end-anchor normalization apply). A value that fails is one
aggregated `Violation`; a value that passes is decoded into the native
bytes value.

Pinned patterns (written `^…$`, **emitted** with the normalized
anchors):

| Encoding | Pinned pattern |
|---|---|
| `base64` | `^(?:[A-Za-z0-9+/]{4})*(?:[A-Za-z0-9+/][AQgw]==\|[A-Za-z0-9+/]{2}[AEIMQUYcgkosw048]=)?$` |
| `base64url` | `^(?:[A-Za-z0-9_-]{4})*(?:[A-Za-z0-9_-][AQgw]\|[A-Za-z0-9_-]{2}[AEIMQUYcgkosw048])?$` |

`base64` accepts canonical **padded** standard base64; `base64url`
accepts canonical **unpadded** URL-safe base64. Both accept the empty
string (→ zero bytes) and reject the *other* encoding's alphabet, wrong
padding, embedded whitespace/newlines, and stray characters — so the
wire is unambiguous and the stdlib decoder below agrees.
The final-character classes constrain unused low bits in the last quantum;
without that constraint, multiple accepted strings could decode to the same
bytes and re-encode differently.

| Language | Strategy |
|---|---|
| Go | Parse adapter: run the encoding's pinned regex over the wire string, pushing a `Violation` on failure; else decode with the codec above → `[]byte`. Encode adapter: re-encode with the same codec. `regexp.MustCompile` compiled once at init. |
| TypeScript | `fromTransferType`: pinned regex (`/…/u`) — **essential**, since the pure-JS decoder assumes canonical input and won't itself reject malformed text — then the generator-owned decoder → `Uint8Array`. `toTransferType`: the generator-owned encoder. Lookup table + arithmetic; **no `Buffer`/`atob`**, so it runs in the browser. |
| Python | `_parse_base64(v, path, violations)` / `_parse_base64url(...)`, called from the converter: regex over the wire string, then `b64decode(s, validate=True)` (`base64`) or `urlsafe_b64decode(s + pad)` (`base64url`) → `bytes`; on failure they append a `Violation` and return `None` so the rest of the object still validates. Serialize: `_format_base64` / `_format_base64url` emit `b64encode(b)` / `urlsafe_b64encode(b).rstrip(b"=")` as ASCII. |
| Java | The per-POJO collecting deserializer (PRINCIPLES Java §5): regex over the `String`, then `Base64.getDecoder()` / `getUrlDecoder()` `.decode(s)` → `byte[]`, pushing a `Violation` on failure. The `Serializer` emits with `getEncoder()` / `getUrlEncoder().withoutPadding()`. |

**Informative `reason` strings.** The `Violation` `reason` names the
encoding and the offending value (`must be base64url-encoded, got "…"`),
per the [[format]] / [[maximum]] convention, truncating a long value.

**Why compile-once.** As [[pattern]] / [[format]]: the pinned pattern is
a package-level compiled constant; the load gate proves it compiles, so
the emitted `MustCompile` / `Pattern.compile` is unconditional.

### Serialize-side (P12)

The materialized field is a **native bytes value that cannot hold an
invalid encoding** — any `[]byte` / `byte[]` / `bytes` / `Uint8Array`
re-encodes to valid base64 — so the type system replaces the
serialize-side *encoding* validator, exactly as [[format]]'s materialized
temporals do. Serialize is therefore a pure **canonicalization** (bytes →
canonical base64/base64url per the node's encoding), the one place
`contentEncoding` has genuine encode-adapter logic. A co-occurring
[[maxLength]] / [[minLength]] / [[pattern]] is **not** subsumed by the
type, though — the canonical base64 can still be too long or off-pattern —
so that predicate re-runs over the canonicalized wire string **before
emit** (**P12**), as those specs describe. The canonical wire string is
projected **once per member** and shared by every predicate on that node,
including a closed-value comparison ([[const]] / [[enum]]), which compares on
that same string. Deriving it independently per predicate makes the emitted
code depend on how many predicates a node happens to carry — which is how a
[[minLength]]`:0`, a bound the spec declares inert, can break a build.

## Property-testing matrix

### Accepted (positive)

| Shape | Example |
|---|---|
| Standard base64 → bytes | `{type:"string", contentEncoding:"base64"}` |
| URL-safe base64 → bytes | `{type:"string", contentEncoding:"base64url"}` |
| Empty content | `""` → zero-length bytes (either encoding) |
| On a nullable string | `{oneOf:[{type:"string", contentEncoding:"base64"},{type:"null"}]}` |
| Combined with `pattern` on the wire | `{type:"string", contentEncoding:"base64", pattern:"^AAA"}` (value must satisfy both) |
| Combined with `maxLength` on the wire | `{type:"string", contentEncoding:"base64", maxLength:1024}` (bounds the *encoded* string) |
| `const` base64 literal | `{type:"string", contentEncoding:"base64", const:"aGk="}` (stored/echoed canonical) |

### Rejected at load time (negative)

| Reason | Example |
|---|---|
| Value not a string | `{contentEncoding:5}`, `{contentEncoding:["base64"]}` |
| Type mismatch (P7.1) | `{type:"integer", contentEncoding:"base64"}` |
| Unsupported encoding | `{…, contentEncoding:"quoted-printable"}`, `"7bit"`, `"8bit"`, `"binary"`, `"base16"` |
| With `contentMediaType` / `contentSchema` | `{…, contentEncoding:"base64", contentMediaType:"image/png"}` → reject (see [[contentMediaType]]) |
| Literal wrong for its encoding | `{…, contentEncoding:"base64", const:"a-b_"}` (URL-safe chars under `base64`); `{…, contentEncoding:"base64url", const:"aGk="}` (padding under `base64url`) |

### Runtime fixtures (validator + round-trip)

- Valid `base64` / `base64url` → decodes to the expected bytes;
  re-serializes **byte-identically** across Go/Java/Python/TS (canonical
  padded / unpadded form respectively).
- Wrong-alphabet or wrong-padding wire (URL-safe `-_` under `base64`,
  `=` padding under `base64url`, missing padding under `base64`, embedded
  newline, stray `!`) → one aggregated `Violation`; **no** language's
  lenient decoder silently accepts it (the regex is the gate).
- The **same bytes** encode to different wire under the two encodings
  (`>>>` → `Pj4+` under `base64`, `Pj4-` under `base64url`) — verified
  distinct and each canonical.
- Empty string → zero-length bytes, round-trips to `""`.
- A failing sibling constraint (`maxLength` / `pattern` / another field)
  → **all** reported in one shot (**P11**).

## Interactions

- **[[type]]**: gates applicability — meaningful only for `string`; a
  mismatch is a load reject (**P7.1**). The **emitted field type is the
  native bytes construct**, not `string` (the wire is still a JSON
  string).
- **[[contentMediaType]] / [[contentSchema]]**: both are **rejected**
  (they have no place to emit in the model). A base64 blob *labeled* with
  a media type therefore rejects on the label, not here — see
  [[contentMediaType]]. This is why materialized bytes are unlabeled
  binary in v1.
- **[[pattern]]**: the pinned encoding patterns stay inside its RE2-safe
  subset and use its compile-once mechanism, ASCII-class rule, and end-anchor
  normalization. Both may appear — the **wire string** must satisfy both.
- **[[format]]**: a **materializing** temporal format cannot share a node with
  `contentEncoding` — both would own the same in-memory slot, and the grammars
  are disjoint anyway (an RFC 3339 form contains `-` and `:`, which no base64
  alphabet admits). **Reject the combination at load**, with a fix-it naming the
  conflict, rather than silently discarding either adapter. A
  **non-materializing** (string-shaped) format is **accepted** beside
  `contentEncoding` and its check applies to the **encoded wire string** in
  *every* target, aggregating with the encoding's check: dropping it in one
  target is an accept-set divergence, and being redundant with the base64 shape
  in most cases does not license omitting it in one.
- **[[minLength]] / [[maxLength]]**: independent string assertions over
  the **encoded wire string** (not the decoded byte length); not
  cross-checked against the base64 shape.
- **[[const]] / [[default]] / [[enum]]**: a supplied string literal MUST
  be valid for the declared encoding at load and is stored / echoed in
  canonical form, mirroring [[format]].
- **[[nullability]]**: orthogonal — a `null` skips the check and is not
  materialized; a present value is checked and decoded. A [[const]] / [[enum]]
  belongs on the **non-null branch**. Putting it on the `oneOf` wrapper is a
  load reject under the shared applicator ownership rule; the diagnostic tells
  the author to move it into the branch whose values it constrains. This keeps
  the null branch and bytes materialization intact without creating a second
  wrapper-level precedence rule.
- **[[oneOf]]**: **deferred** on a non-object branch of a sum type — the
  synthesized `<Union><Kind>` wrapper has no bytes construct to hold, so it is
  rejected rather than materialized in one target and left an unvalidated
  `string` in the others ([[oneOf]] §Deferred). The [[nullability]] `oneOf`
  wrapper is not a sum type and materializes normally.
- **[[uniqueItems]]**: **supported** on a `contentEncoding` element. Because
  only the canonical wire form is accepted, a byte value has exactly one
  spelling, so the encoded strings partition the elements exactly as the decoded
  byte values do. That support is **contingent on** the strictness above:
  admitting unpadded, URL-safe-under-`base64`, or non-canonical trailing bits
  would give one byte value several spellings and bring the element under
  [[uniqueItems]]' deferral.
- **[[contains]]**: `contentEncoding` on a `contains` **matcher** rejects; on
  the **element** it is supported, and the matcher measures the encoded wire
  string in both directions. Every target renders that canonical element
  projection before applying the matcher.
- **[[required]]**: orthogonal — presence vs value shape.

## Ecosystem variance

| Source dialect | Action |
|---|---|
| JSON Schema 2020-12 | Annotation by default; we opt into assertion + materialization for `base64` / `base64url`, reject the rest. Native keyword, no rewrite. |
| OpenAPI 3.1 | Adopts 2020-12 — `contentEncoding` native, same names. The OAS 3.0 `type:"string", format:"byte"` (base64) / `format:"binary"` idioms are **not** JSON Schema formats — rejected as unknown [[format]]s; author should use `contentEncoding:"base64"`. |
| OpenAPI 3.0 | Human porting note: no `contentEncoding`; base64 is spelled `format:"byte"`, which is not a JSON Schema format. A document *declaring* the OAS 3.0 dialect is not an accepted input, but the spelling itself reaches the loader in a `$schema`-less fragment and rejects as an unknown [[format]] — and that diagnostic must name `contentEncoding:"base64"` as the in-subset alternative, since it is the one migration hint an OAS-3.0 author most needs. Not for `format:"binary"`: that means raw octets, so the same hint would silently change the wire. |
| draft-07 | Human porting note: the keyword existed there with the same names. A document that declares draft-07 rejects on the dialect pin before this keyword is inspected; in a `$schema`-less fragment the keyword is read as here — `base64` / `base64url` assert and materialize, every other encoding rejects. |

## Open questions

1. **TS `Uint8Array` vs canonical `string`.** TS materializes via a
   generator-owned pure-JS codec; the [[format]]-style fallback (keep a
   canonical base64 `string` in TS, as `date`/`duration` do) remains the
   conservative alternative if a consumer would rather own the decoding
   themselves.
2. **Media-type-labeled bytes.** Carrying `contentMediaType` as
   **Temporal payload metadata** (rather than a model field) would let
   `{contentEncoding:"base64", contentMediaType:"image/png"}` be
   accepted as labeled binary — see [[contentMediaType]].
