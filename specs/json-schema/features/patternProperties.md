# `patternProperties`

Source: JSON Schema 2020-12, Core (Applicator vocabulary), §10.3.2.2
"Keywords for Applying Subschemas to Objects → patternProperties".

Applies subschemas to members whose **names match a regular
expression**. **Temporarily unsupported** — rejected at load time in v1,
but not a categorical P6 exclusion: a narrow single-pattern form is
plausibly lowerable and is deferred to post-v1.

## Spec summary

Verbatim (2020-12 core, Applicator):

> The value of "patternProperties" MUST be an object. Each property name
> of this object SHOULD be a valid regular expression, according to the
> ECMA-262 regular expression dialect. Each property value of this object
> MUST be a valid JSON Schema.

> Validation succeeds if, for each instance name that matches any regular
> expressions that appear as a property name in this keyword's value, the
> child instance for that name successfully validates against each schema
> that corresponds to a matching regular expression.

> The annotation result of this keyword is the set of instance property
> names matched by this keyword. This annotation affects the behavior of
> "additionalProperties" (in this vocabulary) and "unevaluatedProperties"
> (in the Unevaluated vocabulary).

> Omitting this keyword has the same assertion behavior as an empty
> object.

Distilled:
- Regex-keyed subschemas: members whose name matches a pattern must
  validate against the corresponding subschema.
- A single name may match multiple patterns (must satisfy **all**).
- Contributes to the matched-name annotation that [[additionalProperties]]
  consumes.

## Support decision

**Support:** no — **temporarily unsupported.** Rejected at load time in
v1, but explicitly *deferred*, not categorically excluded: the general
form carries real lowering hazards (below), yet a narrow single-pattern
form is plausibly representable and is tracked for a future release.

Why deferred rather than landed in v1 (citing [[PRINCIPLES.md]]):
- **P6 (strict subset)**: regex-keyed members produce a **dynamically
  keyed** member set that cannot lower to named, statically-typed fields
  in Go/TS/Java/Python. It is a map construct wearing object clothes.
- **P7 / P7.1 (reject ambiguity loudly)**: overlapping patterns mean a
  single member may be governed by several subschemas at once (validate
  against *all* matching) — the emitted value type would be an
  intersection with no coherent cross-language representation.
- **Regex-dialect divergence** compounds it: the spec mandates ECMA-262,
  but Go's `regexp` (RE2) rejects lookahead/backreferences that ECMA-262
  and `java.util.regex` accept. A pattern accepted by the input could be
  unrepresentable in one target's runtime. The value-level [[pattern]] keyword
  at least confines this hazard to one auditable gate; here it multiplies
  across the *key space*.

These hazards apply to the general form only. A single-pattern,
no-`properties`, RE2-safe schema is the candidate carve-out — it is why
this keyword is "temporarily unsupported" rather than a hard P6 reject
like [[dependentSchemas]]. Landing that carve-out first requires a sound
cross-runtime regex gate for pattern keys.

Loader behavior (v1):
- Any `patternProperties` present → reject with a located diagnostic.
- An authored empty `patternProperties: {}` is also rejected as a dead keyword;
  it constrains nothing, so the actionable remedy is to remove it.
- The diagnostic must read as "not yet supported," not "forbidden," and
  offer the two coherent alternatives available today:
  1. A **typed map** — `{type:object, additionalProperties:{type:T}}` —
     when the intent is "arbitrary keys, homogeneous values"
     (see [[additionalProperties]]).
  2. Enumerated **[[properties]]** — when the key set is actually finite
     and known.

## Type mapping

None — rejected before any type is emitted.

## Validator mapping

None — rejected at load time, so there is no (de)serialize boundary and
no serialize-side behavior (**P12**). If the single-pattern typed-map
carve-out later lands, its key+value checks would join the shared
`Validate` and run in both directions exactly like [[propertyNames]]'s
key check.

## Property-testing matrix

### Rejected at load time (negative) — the whole surface

| Reason | Example |
|---|---|
| Any pattern map (P6) | `{type:object, patternProperties:{"^x-":{type:string}}}` |
| With `properties` | `{type:object, properties:{id:{type:integer}}, patternProperties:{"^meta_":{type:string}}}` |
| Overlapping patterns | `{type:object, patternProperties:{"^a":{…}, "a$":{…}}}` |
| RE2-incompatible pattern | `{type:object, patternProperties:{"(?=x)":{type:string}}}` |

All rows currently receive the same keyword-level rejection. Pattern syntax and
overlap are not inspected until a supported carve-out exists.

There are no accepted or runtime fixtures in v1: the keyword does not yet
reach code generation. The single-pattern carve-out, should it land,
would add accepted + runtime rows.

## Interactions

- **[[additionalProperties]]**: per spec, `patternProperties` contributes
  to the matched-name annotation `additionalProperties` consumes. Since
  we reject `patternProperties` at load time in v1, that contribution
  never arises in practice — `additionalProperties` only ever excludes
  [[properties]] matches in our subset.
- **[[unevaluatedProperties]]**: rejected per P6 (a hard exclusion, unlike
  this keyword's temporary status); both belong to the
  annotation-dependent object machinery we exclude.
- **[[propertyNames]]**: the supported escape hatch for *constraining
  key shape* without assigning per-pattern value schemas — partial
  support, map-shaped objects only.
- **[[pattern]]**: the value-level regex keyword; it confines dialect handling
  to one gate, whose portability limitations are documented there.

## Ecosystem variance

| Source dialect | Action |
|---|---|
| JSON Schema 2020-12 | Reject (deferred — see Support decision). |
| OpenAPI 3.1 | `patternProperties` present (3.1 adopts 2020-12) → reject. |
| OpenAPI 3.0 | No `patternProperties` keyword — nothing to reject; users already lean on `additionalProperties`. |
| Swagger 2.0 / draft-4 | `patternProperties` present → reject — though a *declared* older dialect rejects on the `$schema` pin first ([[input-files]]), so only a document with no `$schema` reaches this keyword's diagnostic. |
