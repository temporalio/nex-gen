# `multipleOf`

Source: JSON Schema 2020-12, Validation vocabulary, §6.2.1
"Validation Keywords for Numeric Instances → multipleOf".

Asserts that a numeric instance is an exact multiple of a divisor. A pure
runtime assertion — no type impact. The one numeric keyword with a genuine
floating-point hazard: **divisibility has no portable, intent-preserving
answer for fractional divisors**, so the supported form is narrowed to
positive **integer** divisors, where the check is exact and portable.

## Spec summary

Verbatim (2020-12 validation, §6.2.1):

> The value of "multipleOf" MUST be a number, strictly greater than 0.

> A numeric instance is valid only if division by this keyword's value
> results in an integer.

Distilled:
- Value MUST be a number `> 0`.
- Instance valid iff `instance / value` is an integer.
- Applies to any numeric instance (`integer` or `number`); a non-numeric
  [[type]] → load reject (**P7.1**).

## Support decision

**Support:** partial — **positive integer divisor only**. A fractional
divisor (`multipleOf: 0.1`, `2.5`, …) is **temporarily unsupported**
(rejected at load, deferred — *not* a categorical P6 exclusion). Applies
to both `integer` and `number` fields.

Rationale (citing [[PRINCIPLES.md]]):
- **P1 (identical cross-language validation).** Divisibility must produce
  the *same* accept/reject in Go, TypeScript, Python, and Java for the
  same `(schema, instance)`. Empirically:
  - **Integer divisor → exact and portable.** Integer modulo (`integer`
    fields) and IEEE `fmod` (`number` fields) agree value-for-value across
    all four: Go `math.Mod`, Java `%`, JS `%`, and Python `math.fmod`
    return identical results for integer divisors (`10.0`/`6.0` accepted,
    `7.5` rejected, `1e300` accepted for divisor `2`).
  - **Fractional divisor → no defensible answer.** `fmod` treats the
    stored doubles literally, so `0.3 % 0.1 == 0.09999999999999998` and
    `1.1 % 0.1 == 2.77e-17` — i.e. Go/Java/JS/Python all *reject* `0.3`
    against `multipleOf: 0.1`, which is not what an author writing
    `multipleOf: 0.1` means. The alternative — a **tolerant** divisibility
    check, of the kind several validation libraries ship — *accepts* `0.3`,
    `1.1` and `0.2`, but the tolerance is unspecified and per-library, so
    any target left on raw `fmod` then disagrees. Neither branch is
    reconcilable without imposing a shared decimal algorithm on every
    target.
- **P4 (minimal runtime deps).** A correct fractional check needs decimal
  scaling / big-decimal arithmetic; TypeScript and Go have no native
  decimal type, so we would have to ship one (P4 tension) *and*
  re-implement it identically four times to preserve P1. Not worth it for
  a rare form in v1.
- **P7 / P7.1 (reject ambiguity loudly).** A fractional divisor that
  "looks" like it should accept `0.3` but rejects it (or accepts it in one
  language only) is exactly the silently-incorrect output the mission
  forbids. Reject at load with a clear diagnostic instead.

Loader behavior:
- `multipleOf` not a number → reject.
- `multipleOf ≤ 0` (`0`, `-2`) → reject (spec MUST be `> 0`).
- `multipleOf` fractional (`0.1`, `2.5`, any non-integer-valued number) →
  **reject — temporarily unsupported**, with a "not yet supported"
  diagnostic (distinct from the `≤ 0` error). `multipleOf: 2.0` is
  accepted (≡ `2`, integer-valued, honoring the `1.0`-as-integer rule from
  [[type]]).
- `multipleOf` on a non-numeric [[type]] → reject (**P7.1**).
- Combined with a range ([[minimum]]/[[maximum]]/exclusive*): if **no
  multiple of the divisor lies in the accepted interval**, the schema is
  unsatisfiable → reject. The check is cheap:
  `floor(hi/m)*m ≥ lo` over the effective integer interval `[lo,hi]` (e.g.
  `{type:"integer", minimum:3, maximum:3, multipleOf:2}` → the only value
  `3` is not a multiple of `2` → reject).
  **The check binds over the whole binary64 domain, not only over small
  magnitudes.** It is decided with the same `fmod`-based primitive as the
  runtime predicate, never by taking the fractional part of a
  `bound / divisor` quotient: above `2^52` a double quotient has no
  fractional part at all, so a rounding-to-integer step over it degenerates
  into a no-op and every large bound reports "satisfiable". That is a third
  divisibility semantics, disagreeing with all four runtimes.
  `{type:"number", minimum:1e23, maximum:1e23, multipleOf:5}` is a reject —
  `1e23` is not a multiple of `5` — exactly as its small-magnitude twin is.

**Deferred, not excluded.** A future lowering could support fixed-precision
fractional divisors via decimal scaling (multiply instance and divisor by
`10^k` to integers, then integer-divide), gated on all four targets
agreeing. Revisit on demand — mirrors [[patternProperties]]' "temporarily
unsupported, plausibly lowerable later" posture.

## Type mapping

None. The emitted field type is [[type]]'s primitive; the divisor lives
only in the validator.

## Validator mapping

Per **P10**/**P11**. A single divisibility predicate against the fixed
integer divisor `m`, identical in both directions (shared `Validate`,
**P12**). The predicate is defined per field kind:
- **`integer` field:** `v % m == 0` in exact integer arithmetic.
- **`number` field:** `fmod(v, m) == 0` (IEEE remainder — exact for the
  stored double).

| Language | Strategy |
|---|---|
| Go | A predicate in the shared `Validate`, applied identically on both directions' paths (**P12.2**: sharing is a requirement on the predicate, not on the call graph). Integer field: `if v % m != 0 { push(Violation{Reason: fmt.Sprintf("must be a multiple of %v, got %v", m, v)}) }` (`int64`). Number field: same message when `math.Mod(v, m) != 0` (`float64`). Violations collect into one `PayloadValidationError` application failure. |
| TypeScript | ``if (v % m !== 0) push(Violation{path, reason: `must be a multiple of ${m}, got ${v}`})`` — `%` is IEEE `fmod`, and integer fields are safe integers so it is exact for both kinds. `m` is an emitted numeric constant. Throw one `PayloadValidationError` application failure. |
| Python | An inline check in the transfer type converter (PRINCIPLES Python §3), emitted the same way TypeScript emits it rather than behind a runtime helper, appending `Violation(path, reason=f"must be a multiple of {m}, got {v}")`. **Integer field:** exact Python-`int` modulo, over the value `_parse_spec_integer` has already normalized. **Number field:** `math.fmod(v, m) != 0` — deliberately the same primitive as the other three rather than any *tolerant* native divisibility check, so the predicate is **bit-identical `fmod`** across targets (a tolerant check would only be safe because we reject the fractional divisors where the tolerance would bite; standardizing on `fmod` keeps the predicate provably identical instead). Aggregates into the single generated `PayloadValidationError` application failure. |
| Java | The per-POJO collecting deserializer (PRINCIPLES Java §5) reads the field via the [[type]] `SpecNumbers` helper, then checks `v % m != 0` — `long % long` (integer field) or `double % double` (number field, IEEE `fmod`, matching the others) — pushing a `Violation{path, "must be a multiple of " + m + ", got " + v}` into the single `PayloadValidationError` application failure. Not `BigDecimal.remainder` (would risk decimal-vs-`fmod` divergence on the number path). |

Reason strings name the divisor and offending value (`must be a multiple of
2, got 3`), per the [[maximum]] convention.

For `integer` fields the divisor and value are both within the [[type]]
cap `±(2^53−1)`, so integer modulo is exact everywhere (TS included — safe
integers). For `number` fields IEEE `fmod` is exact and portable across
all four (verified, including large integer-valued doubles like `1e300`).

### Serialize-side (P12)

The divisibility predicate is a shared-`Validate` check, so it **re-runs
before emit** over the decoded value — an in-memory value that is not a
multiple of `m` (a Go `int64` / Java `long` / Python `int` mutated or
constructed off-grid) fails serialize with the aggregated primitive rather
than being written. No parse-adapter-only or encode-adapter-only logic.

## Property-testing matrix

### Accepted (positive)

| Shape | Example |
|---|---|
| Integer divisor on integer | `{type:"integer", multipleOf:2}` |
| Larger integer divisor | `{type:"integer", multipleOf:100}` |
| `.0`-valued divisor | `{type:"integer", multipleOf:2.0}` |
| Integer divisor on number | `{type:"number", multipleOf:5}` |

### Rejected at load time (negative)

| Reason | Example |
|---|---|
| Not `> 0` | `multipleOf:0`, `multipleOf:-2` |
| Fractional divisor (deferred) | `multipleOf:0.1`, `multipleOf:2.5`, `{type:"number", multipleOf:0.01}` |
| Value not a number | `multipleOf:"2"`, `multipleOf:true` |
| Type mismatch (P7.1) | `{type:"string", multipleOf:2}` |
| Unsatisfiable with range | `{type:"integer", minimum:3, maximum:3, multipleOf:2}` |
| Unsatisfiable with range, large magnitude | `{type:"number", minimum:1e23, maximum:1e23, multipleOf:5}` |

### Runtime fixtures (validator)

- **Integer field, `multipleOf:2`:** accept `4`, `0`, `-2`, `4.0`
  (spec-int normalizes then passes); reject `5`, `3`, `5.0`.
- **Number field, `multipleOf:3`:** accept `6.0`, `-9.0`, `0.0`,
  `1e300`-if-divisible; reject `7.5`, `4.0`.
- **No fractional-divisor surprises:** because `multipleOf:0.1` is a load
  reject, the `0.3 %` footgun never reaches runtime — the accepted forms
  are all `fmod`/integer-exact and agree across the four languages.
- Combined with a failing bound / sibling field → all reported in one shot
  (**P11**); serialize of an off-grid in-memory value → rejected (**P12**).

## Interactions

- **[[type]]**: gates applicability (`integer`/`number` only); a mismatch
  is a load reject (**P7.1**). The emitted type is `type`'s primitive.
  Integer fields ride the `±(2^53−1)` cap, which keeps integer modulo
  exact.
- **[[minimum]] / [[maximum]] / [[exclusiveMinimum]] / [[exclusiveMaximum]]**:
  combine for satisfiability — no multiple of the divisor in the accepted
  interval → load reject (rule above). This is the numeric analog of the
  count-satisfiability checks in [[maxProperties]] / [[minProperties]].
- **[[const]] / [[default]] / [[enum]]**: a supplied numeric literal MUST
  be a multiple of `m` at load — e.g. `{type:"integer", multipleOf:2,
  const:3}` and `{…, default:5}` are load rejects. Closes the numeric
  portion of the deferred literal-vs-constraint obligation the [[const]]
  and [[default]] specs flagged.

## Ecosystem variance

| Source dialect | Action |
|---|---|
| JSON Schema 2020-12 | Native. Integer divisors accepted; fractional divisors rejected (deferred). |
| OpenAPI 3.1 | Adopts 2020-12 — same. |
| OpenAPI 3.0 / draft-4 | `multipleOf` present since draft-4 with identical semantics — **but** other toolchains accept fractional divisors (`multipleOf: 0.01` for currency). Such schemas need a rewrite to an integer divisor (e.g. model cents as an `integer`) or must wait for the deferred fractional support. |
| Swagger 2.0 | Same as OAS 3.0. |
