# `const`

Source: JSON Schema 2020-12, Validation vocabulary, §6.1.3
"Validation Keywords for Any Instance Type → const".

Pins an instance to a single fixed value. The discriminator primitive:
a `const` string on a member is how a typed object announces its
variant on the wire. Supported for scalar values. `const` is a **pure
assertion** — a single-value [[enum]] — checked in both directions by
the shared `Validate` layer (**P12**): any value other than the fixed
one is **rejected** (**P13.1**). It carries **no serialize-side
special-casing**: the value reaches the wire because it is *set in
memory* (by the TS literal type, by the Java value constant, or by the
consumer in Go and Python — a required+const is a required field), not
because the serializer rewrites it.

## Spec summary

Verbatim (2020-12 validation, §6.1.3):

> The value of this keyword MAY be of any type, including null.

> Use of this keyword is functionally equivalent to an "enum" (Section
> 6.1.2) with a single value.

> An instance validates successfully against this keyword if its value
> is equal to the value of the keyword.

Distilled:
- A single-value assertion: the instance must **equal** the keyword's
  value — JSON equality, which compares **values and not their written
  form**. For the three scalar kinds that matters: a string compares by
  code points, a boolean by itself, and a **number by its mathematical
  value**, so a `const: 1` is satisfied by the wire tokens `1`, `1.0` and
  `1e0` alike, and `-0.0` equals `0.0` ([[type]]'s identity rule). A
  numeric `const` names one number, never one spelling of it; anywhere the
  generator has to decide whether two `const` values are *the same value* —
  the [[oneOf]] discriminator's pairwise distinctness above all — this is
  the comparison it owes, and comparing JSON representations instead would
  treat one value as two.
- Equivalent to `enum: [<value>]`; see [[enum]].
- Value may be any JSON type. In our subset only **scalar** consts
  (string / number / integer / boolean) are supported; `null` and
  composite (object / array) consts are handled below.
- It is an **assertion**, not an annotation — unlike [[default]], a
  non-matching value is a hard validation failure.

## Support decision

**Support:** yes (scalar values) — a runtime equality assertion, nothing
more. `const: null` and composite consts are rejected/deferred.

Rationale (citing [[PRINCIPLES.md]]):
- **P10 (enforced)**: the equality check runs at the (de)serializer
  boundary, aggregated per **P11**. It is a pure predicate over the
  decoded value, identical in both directions — the **shared `Validate`**
  layer of **P12**, with no serialize-side adapter logic of its own.
- **P13.1 (closed value set; unknown values rejected)**: `const` is a
  **closed contract** — the field admits only the fixed value, and any
  other value is a hard validation failure. The emitted type expresses
  that closedness in each language's idiom, for **every scalar kind**: a
  **closed literal** where literal types exist (TS `"v1"` / `1.5` /
  `true`; Python `Literal["v1"]`, with `float` the one exception — see
  Type mapping), a **defined type + typed constant** in Go
  (`type UserEventKind string` + `UserEventKindUser`), and a **value
  class** in Java (a known constant, obtainable only through the class).
  A schema revision that bumps the value (`"v1"`→`"v2"`) is a **breaking
  change** to the contract and surfaces as one — a compile error at stale
  call sites (the literal changes in TS/Python; the value-derived constant
  is renamed in Go/Java) — the correct, loud outcome: a changed value
  contract is not backward compatible, and the generator does not pretend
  otherwise. [[enum]] is the same closed machinery with more than one
  known value.
- **No auto-emit.** Like [[enum]], `const` is validated, not
  force-written: validate that the value equals the keyword on every model —
  whether constructed in-language or deserialized over the wire. The
  generator does **not** force-write the fixed value on serialize. The
  value lands on the wire because it is *set in memory*, and **presence
  is governed by [[required]]**, like every other field — a required+const
  is always present (so always emitted) for the same reason any required
  field is. Not force-writing keeps the serializer free of const
  special-casing and stops it from **silently rewriting** a wrong
  in-memory value: setting `kind="admin"` on a type whose const is
  `"user"` fails `Validate` loudly instead of being masked.

Loader behavior:
- `const` value type-incompatible with the declared [[type]] → reject
  per **P7.1** (`{type:"integer", const:"x"}` is statically
  unsatisfiable). Numeric compatibility is **directional** and owned by
  [[type]]: an integral value inhabits `integer` and `number` alike, a
  fractional one inhabits `number` only, so `{type:"integer", const:1.5}`
  rejects — including when the pairing arrives through an [[allOf]] merge.
  An `integer` value outside the `±(2^53−1)` cap likewise rejects, because
  it names a value the field can never hold. The const value must validate
  against the **rest** of the field's own schema too (e.g.
  `{type:"string", minLength:5, const:"ab"}` → reject — the fixed value can
  never satisfy the field).
  The const value is run through every *constraint* keyword present on the
  same node — [[pattern]], [[minLength]]/[[maxLength]],
  [[minimum]]/[[maximum]], [[exclusiveMinimum]]/[[exclusiveMaximum]],
  [[multipleOf]] — using that keyword's own load-time validator over the
  fixed value; a violation is a load reject. **Each constraint keyword
  owns its half of this check** (its spec states the rule and lists the
  const/default/enum load reject); `const` supplies the fixed value and
  inherits every such check that is present. The same obligation applies
  to [[default]] and [[enum]].
- `const` **and** [[default]] both present → reject. A const fixes the
  value; a default is then either redundant (equal) or contradictory
  (unequal). Diagnostic: drop the `default`; the const already
  determines the value.
- `const` **and** [[enum]] both present → reject as redundant (const is
  a single-value enum; pick one spelling). Diagnostic points at the
  equivalence.
- `const: null` → **reject**. A field that is *always* `null` carries no
  information — the same degenerate case as a standalone `{type:"null"}`
  (see [[type]]). If the intent is "nullable", use the [[nullability]]
  pattern; if "absent", omit the field.
- `const` **on a [[oneOf]] node** — a sum type *or* a [[nullability]]
  wrapper — → **reject**, with a fix-it naming the branch to move it to. A
  union node carries no scalar `type`, so the compatibility gate above has
  nothing to check the value against; a closed value set belongs on the
  branch whose kind it closes. This is [[oneOf]]'s sibling rule and
  [[nullability]]'s wrapper-versus-branch rule applied to `const`, and it is
  a **P7.1** obligation rather than a style preference: authored on the union
  node the value set is neither uniformly enforced nor uniformly dropped, so
  one schema names a different accepted value set in each target.
- Composite const (`const` whose value is an **object or array**) →
  **temporarily unsupported**; reject at load with a "not yet supported"
  diagnostic (not a categorical P6 exclusion — the deep structural-equality
  check is correct in principle, just costly; deferred past v1 and
  revisit on demand). Contrast [[default]], which explicitly avoids
  deep-equals; for `const` the deep-equals would be a genuine assertion,
  not an omission heuristic.

## Type mapping

The emitted type is **closed to the const value**, in each language's
idiom and for **every scalar kind** (**P13.1**). Optional vs required
wrapping is owned by [[required]] / [[nullability]].

| const value kind | Go | TypeScript | Python | Java |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| string  | `type UserEventKind string` + typed const | `"<v>"` | `Literal["<v>"]` | value class `UserEventKind` |
| integer | `type Priority int64` + typed const       | `<v>`   | `Literal[<v>]`   | value class `Priority` |
| number  | `type Ratio float64` + typed const        | `<v>`   | `float`          | value class `Ratio` |
| boolean | `type Enabled bool` + typed const         | `<v>`   | `Literal[<v>]`   | value class `Enabled` |

**Go.** A **defined type** over the primitive plus a typed value
constant, for every scalar kind:

```go
type UserEventKind string
const UserEventKindUser = UserEventKind("user")

type Priority int64
const Priority3 = Priority(3)
```

The field is typed with the defined type (`Kind UserEventKind`); the
value constant is the idiomatic way to set it
(`UserEvent{Kind: UserEventKindUser}`) and the value the validator
compares against. The defined type gives the value its own name, groups
the constant(s) under it, and provides **safety on initialization** — a
bare primitive requires a deliberate cast (`Priority(4)`) to reach the
field, so a wrong value is a conscious act, caught by `Validate`. It
generalizes directly to [[enum]], which lists several constants under one
type. The value-constant name is `{Type}{EncodedValue}` (see Naming and
encoding). Both the defined type and each value constant are exported, so
both carry a name-led doc comment (PRINCIPLES.md, Go §1) — the type's from
the owning property's [[title]]/[[description]] when present, else a
fallback naming the declaring model and field; each constant's states the
value it holds (e.g. `// UserEventKindUser is the UserEventKind value
"user".`).

**TypeScript.** The **closed literal** of the value — `kind: "user"`,
`n: 1.5`, `ok: true`. The literal type closes the field in-language (a
wrong value is a compile error); the deserialize validator compares the
wire value against the same literal.

**Python.** The **closed literal** via `Literal` — `Literal["user"]`,
`Literal[1]`, `Literal[True]` — carried as the dataclass field's default so
a consumer never has to restate the fixed value. **`float` consts are the
exception:** `Literal` forbids float members (PEP 586), so a number const
is plain `float` and closedness rests on the converter's equality check
alone.

**Java.** A generated **value class** wrapping the primitive, for every
scalar kind — a known constant, a private constructor, and Jackson
`@JsonCreator`/`@JsonValue` for wire mapping:

```java
public final class UserEventKind {
    public static final UserEventKind USER = new UserEventKind("user");
    private final String value;
    private UserEventKind(String value) { this.value = value; }

    @JsonCreator                              // standalone / interop decode
    public static UserEventKind fromString(String v) {
        if (v == null) return null;
        if ("user".equals(v)) return USER;
        throw new IllegalArgumentException(
            "must equal \"user\", got \"" + v + "\"");
    }
    @JsonValue public String getValue() { return value; }
    // equals/hashCode/toString by value (omitted)
}
```

Where a member receives this carrier, the private constructor makes the
known constant the only obtainable instance, so a wrong value **cannot be
constructed** in-language. The carrier is emitted for an **object
property**; an **array element** and a **typed-map value** keep the
primitive Java type, so in those positions closedness rests on the runtime
equality check alone ([[enum]] states the same scope for the multi-value
form). The value class is the shared carrier of `const` (one constant) and
[[enum]] (several). Numeric and boolean value classes
wrap `long`/`double`/`boolean`, with `@JsonCreator` over the corresponding
primitive. How the aggregating deserialize path validates (without the
throw defeating aggregation) is in Validator mapping.

**Float exactness (all languages).** A number const is compared with
**exact `==`**, never an epsilon — it is an equality assertion, and an
epsilon would admit near-but-unequal values. The comparison is
deterministic and portable: the wire value and the const literal are both
IEEE-754 binary64 produced by correctly-rounded decimal→double parsing,
so the same decimal yields the identical bit pattern in every language
and on every architecture (the path only parses and compares, never
computes). The loader carries the value through its shortest
round-trippable decimal, so every target re-parses to the same double.
`-0.0` equals `0.0`; `NaN`/`±Infinity` cannot appear (not JSON literals);
an integer-valued number such as `1.0` **is the same value as** `1` —
equality is over the mathematical number, never the authored spelling. That
is a claim about the comparison, not about a rewriting step, and it leaves
the carrier alone: on a `type: number` node the constant and the field stay
the target's binary64 type (see [[type]]).
A float const asserts *exact* equality to one specific double, so it is
intended for values transmitted as authored — not values arrived at by
upstream computation.

### Naming and collisions (P15)

A `const` synthesizes identifiers that do not exist in the input schema —
a **named type** (Go defined type / Java value class) and a **value
constant** — for every scalar kind. (TS and Python close the type to an
inline literal and synthesize no type or constant; the value lives in the
literal and the validator.) **Type-name derivation follows the
[[properties]] resolved policy:** reuse the `$defs` name when the const is
a **named** definition; when it is **anonymous** (inline on a property),
nest the synthesized type inside its enclosing model where the language
allows it, so it leaves the package/module namespace.

> **`$defs`-named scalar closed values are unimplemented.** A `$defs` entry
> must currently be `type: object`, a `oneOf` union, or a bare `$ref`, so
> `$defs: {Color: {type: string, enum: [red, green, blue]}}` is a load
> reject in all four languages. Every "named definition" branch below —
> the `$defs`-name reuse, the P15 row for a `$defs`-named type, and
> `x-<lang>-const-name` on a `$defs` node — describes the intended design
> and is unreachable until scalar `$defs` entries are admitted.

| Target | Synthesized identifier(s) | Placement / scope |
|---|---|---|
| Go | defined type `UserEventKind` **+** value const `UserEventKindUser` | **flat package** (Go has no nested types); P15 backstop |
| Java | value class `Kind` + class-scoped constant (`USER`) | **nested** `UserEvent.Kind` |
| TypeScript | none — the type is the inline literal `"user"` | — |
| Python | none — the type is the inline `Literal["user"]` | — |

Per **P15** every synthesized name enters the **same per-scope
namespace** as the declared names and as one another; the generator runs
a single collision pass (after case-mapping) and **rejects at load** with
a fix-it diagnostic on any coincidence. A **type-name** collision is
resolved by the [[properties]] `x-<lang>-name` override on the declaring
member — the synthesized type is named from the member, so re-mapping it
moves the type. A **value-constant** collision is resolved by the
`x-<lang>-const-name` override on the const schema (see [Overriding the
value constant](#overriding-the-value-constant)) — the value constant is
named from the *value*, a separate axis that `x-<lang>-name` does not
touch. Nesting shrinks the
surface (a nested `UserEvent.Kind` cannot clash with a top-level
`UserEventKind`); **Go** stays flat and relies on the P15 backstop. **No
auto-mangling** — a synthesized `UserEventKind2` would be unstable across
schema revisions (P13). The class-body surface where **many** constants
can case-map together (`"user"` + `"USER"` → both `USER`) is exercised by
[[enum]].

**The pass runs over the schema that is emitted.** Naming derivation,
encodability and collision are properties of the value set the generator
actually emits a constant for, so they are decided **once**, on the resolved
node — after an [[allOf]] merge and after a `$ref` resolution. An authored
`allOf` branch is an input to that
merge and not an emitted namespace of its own: a branch value that would
encode to a colliding or illegal token, but that the merge removes, is not a
collision, and rejecting it would refuse a schema whose emitted form is
clean. Shape checks that a merge could silently discard still run per branch
— see [[allOf]], which owns the split.

### Naming and encoding (value → identifier)

Go and Java name the value constant after the **value** — Go
`{Type}{EncodedValue}`, Java a class-scoped `{EncodedValue}` — so the
value is encoded as an identifier through the [[properties]] Stage 1–4
pipeline, with a per-kind front-end producing the token and a **constant
recasing scope** (Go `PascalCase`, Java `UPPER_SNAKE`):

| kind | token | Go | Java |
|---|---|---|---|
| string  | value split on **any non-alphanumeric ASCII** into words (Stage 1) | `UserEventKindUser` | `USER` |
| integer | the digits | `Priority3` | `V_3` |
| number  | shortest round-trippable decimal, `.` → `_` | `Ratio3_14` | `V_3_14` |
| boolean | `True` / `False` | `EnabledTrue` | `TRUE` / `FALSE` |

Rules:
- **Negatives** encode the sign as the word `Neg`: `-3` → `PriorityNeg3` /
  `V_NEG_3`; `-3.14` → `RatioNeg3_14`.
- **Numbers** encode from the shortest round-trippable decimal; the `.`
  becomes `_` and is **kept** (so `3_14` stays distinct from `314`). A
  magnitude that canonicalizes to exponent form encodes `e` as `E`, drops a
  positive exponent sign, and encodes a negative one via `Neg` (`1e-7` →
  `Ratio1ENeg7`, `1e+20` → `Ratio1E20`). The decimal comes from the
  **value**, not the authored spelling: P1 makes `1`, `1.0` and `1e0` one
  number, so an integral value collapses to its integer form and all three
  spellings name one constant (`Score1` / `V_1`). Re-spelling a `const` is a
  no-op on the wire and must not rename a constant out from under callers
  (P13). **This holds at every magnitude.** There is no threshold above which
  the authored spelling is used instead — falling back to it past `2^53` would
  both reintroduce the instability the canonical decimal exists to remove
  (`1e+20` and `100000000000000000000` are one number and must name one
  constant) and let characters that are legal in a JSON number but not in an
  identifier — `+` above all — reach the emitted token, where Go and Java do
  not even parse.
- **Java leading-letter guarantee.** Java constants are class-scoped with
  no type prefix, and Stage 3 rejects an identifier beginning with a
  digit. A token that does not start with an ASCII letter (every numeric,
  and digit-leading strings) is prefixed `V_`; string and boolean tokens
  that already start with a letter are used as-is (`USER`, `TRUE`). Go
  needs no prefix — the `{Type}` prefix always supplies a leading letter.
- **Empty or illegal** encodings are **rejected at load** by Stage 3 —
  e.g. a string const `"-"` (all separators → empty token) — with a
  diagnostic pointing at the `x-<lang>-const-name` override (below), which
  names the value constant directly. `x-<lang>-name` cannot rescue it: that
  override moves the synthesized *type*, whereas the empty token belongs to
  the *value constant* (in Java the constant has no member-derived
  component at all — it is purely the encoded value).
- The encoding is a **readable handle, not a lossless round-trip**: it is
  intentionally many-to-one (`"user-admin"`, `"user_admin"`, `"userAdmin"`
  all → `UserAdmin`; string `"3"` and integer `3` both → `…3`). Genuine
  clashes are caught by the P15 collision pass and **rejected**, never
  auto-mangled. Because a number token derives from the canonical
  round-trippable decimal, the name is stable across schema revisions
  (P13).
- `const` string values are restricted to **ASCII without whitespace**
  (rejected at load otherwise), keeping the string front-end to the Stage
  1 word-splitter.

### Overriding the value constant

The value constant is named from the **value**, on a different axis from
the member name. The [[properties]] `x-<lang>-name` override moves the
synthesized **type** (which *is* derived from the member) but leaves the
value constant untouched — in **Java** the constant is purely the encoded
value with no member-derived component, and a **`$defs`**-named const has
no declaring member at all (the motivating case, though a scalar `$defs`
entry does not load yet — see *Naming and collisions*). So the escape hatch
for the value-constant
axis is a separate override, **`x-<lang>-const-name`** (`x-go-const-name`
/ `x-java-const-name`), placed on the **const schema** — the node carrying
`const`, whether inline on a property or a named `$defs` definition. Like
`x-<lang>-name` it is used **verbatim** (it skips the Stage 1–4 encoding),
must itself be a legal, non-reserved identifier in that language, and
participates in the P15 collision pass. Only **Go** and **Java**
synthesize a value constant; **TS** and **Python** carry the value in an
inline literal and have nothing to override, so the keyword is inert
there. This is the only way to admit a value that encodes to an empty or
illegal token (`const "-"`) or to separate two values whose encodings
case-map together (`"user-admin"` ⨯ `"user_admin"` → both `UserAdmin`),
consistent with the **no-auto-mangling** rule (P13/P15).

[[enum]] runs the same value→constant encoding per member, so it inherits
the same empty/illegal-token and encoding-clash cases; the per-value
override mechanism for the multi-value form is specified there.

## Validator mapping

Per **P10**/**P11**. A single equality check against the fixed value,
identical in both directions (it is a pure predicate over the decoded
value — the **shared `Validate`** layer of **P12**).

| Language | Strategy |
|---|---|
| Go | A predicate in the shared `Validate`, applied identically on both directions' paths (**P12.2**: sharing is a requirement on the predicate, not on the call graph, so reaching it through `Validate` or emitting the same check inline is an emission choice): `if v != UserEventKindUser { … Violation{Path, Reason: fmt.Sprintf("must equal %q, got %q", UserEventKindUser, v)} }`, collected into one `PayloadValidationError` application failure. The field is the defined type; the typed constant is both the compared value and the idiomatic setter (`UserEvent{Kind: UserEventKindUser}`). |
| TypeScript | the shared `Validate` predicate compares against the literal: ``if (v !== "user") push(Violation{path, reason: `must equal "user", got ${JSON.stringify(v)}`})``, throwing one `PayloadValidationError` application failure. The field's literal type closes it in-language. |
| Python | the transfer type converter (PRINCIPLES Python §3) compares against the literal — `v != "user"` → `Violation(path=…, reason='must equal "user", got <json>')`, the same reason string TypeScript emits — aggregated into the single generated `PayloadValidationError` application failure. The field is the closed `Literal` (`float` consts are plain `float`, validated the same way). |
| Java | the aggregating path is the per-POJO collecting deserializer (PRINCIPLES Java §5), which does a **non-throwing membership lookup** — known value → the constant, otherwise record a `Violation{path, "must equal \"user\", got …"}` — so multiple bad fields all collect into the single `PayloadValidationError` application failure, consistent with every other §5 constraint helper. The value class's `@JsonCreator fromString` *throws* only on the **standalone/interop** path, where fail-fast is expected. Serialize needs no separate check: the value class can only hold a known constant. |

### Co-authored assertions on the same node

A closed value set may sit beside a string or numeric assertion
([[minLength]]/[[maxLength]], [[pattern]], [[format]],
[[minimum]]/[[maximum]], [[multipleOf]], …). The load gate has already run
every such keyword's own validator over the fixed value (see Loader
behavior), so the assertion cannot fail for an admissible value — and it is
nonetheless **still emitted**. **Closedness changes the carrier, never the
assertion.** Where a target gives the closed set its own named type — Go's
defined type, Java's value class — the co-emitted predicate is evaluated over
that value's **underlying primitive**, converting at the call site. Handing
the named type straight to a primitive that takes the underlying type does
not compile, and dropping the predicate instead would make the emitted
validator depend on the load-time check having been exact.
[[maxLength]]/[[minLength]], [[pattern]] and [[format]] state this same rule
from their side; it is one rule, not four.

On a **materialized** node — a temporal [[format]] or a [[contentEncoding]] —
both the assertion and the closed-value comparison measure the **canonical**
wire string rather than the authored literal. That string is projected **once
per member** and both predicates read that one projection. Two independent
projections are two operands, which is exactly the drift **P12.2** forbids,
and a second projection in the same scope is also a redeclaration in the
targets that emit straight-line code.

### Serialize-side (P12)

There is **no const-specific serialize logic**. `const` rides the same
encode path as every other field: a set field is emitted, an unset
optional field is omitted. Presence is owned entirely by [[required]] —
a required+const is always present (so always emitted), an optional+const
emits iff the consumer opted it in. The fixed value reaches the wire
because each language guarantees it is *set in memory*, never because the
adapter rewrites it:

| declaration | in-memory | serialize |
|---|---|---|
| required + const | always set (by type / `final` / consumer) | emitted by the normal encode path |
| optional + const | present iff the consumer opts the member in | emitted **if set**, omitted if unset (normal omit-unset) |

How each language guarantees "set in memory" — and validates on the way
in:

| Language | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| Go | Field typed with the defined type (`Kind UserEventKind`), set idiomatically via the typed value constant (`UserEvent{Kind: UserEventKindUser}`). A forgotten field is the zero value (`UserEventKind("")`), which the shared `Validate` rejects **loudly** on serialize — consistent with how Go treats every required field. optional+const uses a pointer to the defined type + `,omitempty`, validated when non-nil. |
| TypeScript | The field is the closed literal (`kind: "user"`); a wrong value is a compile error, so a required+const is always correct in memory and emitted by the normal `toTransferType`. optional+const emits when not `undefined`. |
| Python | Presence follows [[required]] like any field — **no auto-fill on parse**: a required+const absent on the wire is a `"required"` violation, an optional+const absent stays omitted, and `from_transfer_type` enforces `== "user"` whenever the value is present. In memory the dataclass field carries the const as its **default**, so a consumer never has to restate it and `to_transfer_type` always has the right value to write; it re-checks equality before emitting the key. This all runs under the **default Temporal converter** (PRINCIPLES Python §3). |
| Java | `private final UserEventKind kind = UserEventKind.USER;` for required+const, getter only. The value class can only hold a known constant, so the getter (via `@JsonValue`) emits `"user"` by the normal path. On the way in, the collecting deserializer's membership lookup records a `Violation` for a non-`"user"` wire value. optional+const is a `@Nullable UserEventKind` constructor parameter, validated if non-null. Numeric/boolean consts use their value classes the same way. |

The serialize equality check has teeth only where a wrong value can be
set in memory before emit: an optional+const set to a wrong value, a Go
zero-value/mutated field, or any Python in-memory assignment (a dataclass
validates nothing on construction, PRINCIPLES Python §1). Where a closing
carrier *is* emitted — the TypeScript literal, and the Java value class on
a required+const object property (`final`) — the value cannot be wrong in
memory, so the check is effectively a deserialize-direction guard. Java
array-element and typed-map positions keep the primitive carrier (Type
mapping), so there it has teeth in both directions.

## Property-testing matrix

### Accepted (positive)

| Shape | Example |
|---|---|
| String discriminator | `{type:"string", const:"user"}` |
| String needing encoding | `{type:"string", const:"user-admin"}` → `UserAdmin` |
| Integer const | `{type:"integer", const:3}` |
| Boolean const | `{type:"boolean", const:true}` |
| Float const (exact `==`) | `{type:"number", const:3.14}` → `Ratio3_14` |
| Negative float const | `{type:"number", const:-3.14}` → `RatioNeg3_14` |
| Integer-valued number const | `{type:"number", const:1.0}` → value `1`, name `Ratio1`, carrier still `number` |
| Un-encodable value rescued by override | `{type:"string", const:"-", x-go-const-name:"Dash", x-java-const-name:"DASH"}` → Go `Dash`, Java `DASH` (empty token would otherwise reject; TS/Python inert) |

### Rejected at load time (negative)

| Reason | Example |
|---|---|
| Type-incompatible (P7.1) | `{type:"integer", const:"x"}` |

| Synthesized-name collision (P15) | Go flat `UserEventKind`/`UserEventKindUser` ⨯ a declared top-level name; a `$defs`-named const reusing an existing type name; two values whose encodings collide (`"user-admin"` ⨯ `"user_admin"` → both `UserAdmin`). Type-name clash → `x-<lang>-name` on the declaring member, which moves the synthesized type because it is named `<Type><Member>` off the *emitted* member identifier (`kind` + `x-go-name: Category` → `ProbeCategory`); value-constant clash → `x-<lang>-const-name`. (Nesting removes the Java anonymous case; Go stays flat → still caught. TS and Python close the type inline and synthesize no named type; TS still emits a module-scope `<FIELD>_CONST` binding for the value, which joins the same collision pass — two of them can coincide through the model-name disambiguator, e.g. a prefixed `A.kind` → `A_KIND_CONST` against an unprefixed `C.aKind`, and emitting both would be a duplicate `const` in one module.) |

### Runtime fixtures (validator)

- Wire value equals const → OK (both directions).
- Wire value present but `!= const` → one `PayloadValidationError` application failure naming the
  expected and actual value (`must equal "user", got "admin"`).
- required+const **absent on the wire** → required violation (see
  [[required]]), reported as a presence error, not a const error.
- Serialize of a correctly-set required const → the fixed value on the
  wire (TS/Java cannot be wrong; Python requires the field, so the
  consumer sets it; Go set via the value constant).
- Serialize of a Go zero-value / bypassed required const
  (`Kind == UserEventKind("")`) → rejected **loudly** by `Validate`, not
  silently rewritten (the generator never force-writes the value).
- Serialize after mutating an optional+const to a wrong value → rejected
  before emit (**P12**).
- Override-named const (`const:"-"` + `x-go-const-name:"Dash"` /
  `x-java-const-name:"DASH"`): wire value `"-"` round-trips — validates
  equal in both directions (the override renames the constant, not the
  compared value), and the value constant (Go `Dash`, Java `DASH`) sets it
  in memory; any other wire value → one `PayloadValidationError` application failure
  (`must equal "-", got …`). Confirms the override affects only the
  synthesized identifier, never the equality check.

## Interactions

- **[[enum]]**: `const` ≡ a single-element `enum` (spec §6.1.3), and the
  two **share one representation** — a closed value set that rejects any
  unrecognized value (TS/Python literal, Go defined type + value consts,
  Java value class). `const` is the single-value specialization; [[enum]]
  lists several known values in the same machinery. We reject the two
  together; `const` is the canonical spelling for the one-value case,
  [[enum]] for the multi-value case. An off-set value is a hard reject in
  both.
- **[[type]]**: the const value must be assignable to the declared type;
  mismatch is a load-time reject (**P7.1**). The emitted type is closed to
  that value — a literal / defined type / value class over `type`'s
  primitive mapping (**P13.1**).
- **[[required]]**: owns presence entirely. required+const is always set
  in memory (so always emitted) — the discriminator — for the same reason
  any required field is; optional+const is validated-if-present and
  emit-if-set. const itself adds no serialize behavior; it only asserts
  the value.
- **[[default]]**: mutually exclusive (load reject). `const` fixes the
  value; `default` supplies one for absence — combining them is
  redundant or contradictory. The two sit at opposite ends: a required
  `const` is always present and asserted; a `default` value is *off the
  wire* (omit-unset) and only materialized on read. That opposition is
  exactly why they don't co-occur.
- **[[oneOf]] / discriminated unions**: a per-branch `const` on a shared
  required member name **is** the discriminator [[oneOf]] keys on for object
  tagged unions — `const` specifies the *value* contract, and [[oneOf]]
  reuses it (unchanged) as the selector. Because the discriminator type is
  **closed** (**P13.1**), bumping a branch's `const` value is a deliberate
  breaking change to that branch, surfaced at compile time — the intended,
  loud outcome for a changed contract. The pairwise distinctness [[oneOf]]
  requires of those discriminators is decided by **value equality**, the same
  equality this spec's Float-exactness rule and [[type]]'s identity rule
  define: `const: 1` and `const: 1.0` are one value, so two branches carrying
  them are not distinct and the union rejects. Comparing JSON
  *representations* instead would admit that union while the emitted dispatch
  — which selects numerically — could never reach its second branch. A `const`
  on the union node itself is a reject (Loader behavior); the discriminator
  lives inside each branch.
- **[[items]] / [[contains]]**: two closed value sets over the same value
  position must **intersect** — a closed-value element type and a
  closed-value [[contains]] matcher with disjoint sets describe an array no
  value can satisfy, so the schema is unsatisfiable and rejects at load. Only
  emptiness rejects; a matcher that narrows the element's set is accepted
  ([[contains]] owns that case, [[enum]] the multi-value form of this one).
- **[[minProperties]] / [[maxProperties]]**: an **object-level** const
  would pin the exact member set, making the count statically decidable
  (noted in both specs) — but object-level const is deferred (see Loader
  behavior above), so that interaction is dormant in v1. A
  **property-level** const only constrains a value if present; it affects
  the count only when paired with [[required]].
- **[[nullability]]**: `const: null` is rejected (degenerate). A nullable
  member with a fixed value is the nullability `oneOf` with the `const`
  authored **on the non-null branch**; the wrapper node must not carry it
  (Loader behavior). The two axes stay orthogonal there: the branch's value
  set is closed and the field still admits an explicit `null`, which the
  closed check never sees.

## Ecosystem variance

| Source dialect | Action |
|---|---|
| JSON Schema 2020-12 | Native (scalar). Native. |
| OpenAPI 3.1 | Adopts 2020-12 — `const` native. |
| OpenAPI 3.0 | No `const` keyword; the idiom is `enum: [<value>]`. A single-element `enum` → accept as the equivalent const (single-value [[enum]] handling). |
| Swagger 2.0 / draft-4 | No `const` (draft-6+); single-element `enum` → same as OAS 3.0. |

- [[enum]] — the multi-value sibling; `const` ≡ single-element enum,
  sharing one closed representation (both reject unrecognized values).
- [[properties]] — owns the identifier case-mapping + collision/escape-hatch
  policy that governs const's synthesized type/value-const names (P15).
- [[type]] — supplies the emitted primitive type; gates value
  compatibility.
- [[required]] — owns presence; a required+const is the always-present
  discriminator (because it is required, not because const says so).
- [[default]] — the semantic opposite (off-the-wire/omit-unset vs
  always-present-and-asserted); mutually exclusive with `const`.
- [[nullability]] — `const: null` rejected; otherwise orthogonal.
- [[oneOf]] — object discriminated-union dispatch keys on a required `const`.
- [[minProperties]] / [[maxProperties]] — object-level const (deferred)
