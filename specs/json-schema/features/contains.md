# `contains`

Source: JSON Schema 2020-12, Core (Applicator vocabulary), §10.3.1.3
"Keywords for Applying Subschemas to Arrays → contains".

Asserts that **at least one element** of an array instance matches a
subschema — the array *existential*. A pure runtime assertion; no type
impact. Where [[items]] constrains **every** element and [[uniqueItems]]
compares elements **to each other**, `contains` asks only whether **some**
element satisfies a matcher — most often "the array holds this value"
(`contains:{const:"admin"}`) or "some element clears this bound"
(`contains:{type:integer, minimum:5}`). Like [[uniqueItems]], its support
envelope is drawn at the **scalar/composite** line: a scalar matcher over
the (necessarily scalar) element type is a cheap, trivially portable
predicate; a composite matcher requires the deferred deep-match surface.

## Spec summary

Verbatim (2020-12 core, Applicator, §10.3.1.3):

> The value of this keyword MUST be a valid JSON Schema.

> An array instance is valid against "contains" if at least one of its
> elements is valid against the given schema, except when "minContains" is
> present and has a value of 0, in which case an array instance MUST be
> considered valid against the "contains" keyword, even if none of its
> elements is valid against the given schema.

> This keyword produces an annotation value which is an array of the
> indexes to which this keyword's subschema is valid. […] The subschema
> MUST be applied to every array element even after the first match has
> been found, in order to collect annotations for use by other keywords.

> Omitting this keyword has the same assertion behavior as an empty schema.

Distilled:
- The value is a full subschema — the **matcher**. The array is valid iff
  **≥ 1 element** validates against it (the spec default, i.e.
  `minContains` omitted ≡ `1`).
- The match count can be re-floored/capped by [[minContains]] /
  [[maxContains]] (both supported — their own specs); `contains` **alone**
  means the **spec-default ≥ 1 match** (`minContains` omitted ≡ `1`).
- The annotation (matching indexes) exists only to feed
  [[unevaluatedItems]], which is **rejected** per **P6**. With no
  annotation consumer, the "apply to every element even after the first
  match" clause has no observable effect — we short-circuit at the first
  match (see Validator mapping).
- Applies only to array instances; a `contains` on a non-array [[type]] is
  rejected at load (**P7.1**), like every array keyword.

## Support decision

**Support:** yes for a **scalar matcher over a scalar element [[type]]**
(string / number / integer / boolean); **composite** matchers or composite
element types (object / array) are **deferred** — a load reject with a "not
yet supported" diagnostic, exactly the stance [[uniqueItems]] / [[const]] /
[[enum]] take on composite values (a portable deep-match is correct in
principle, just costly — revisit on demand).

Because `type:"array"` **requires** [[items]] in this subset (no untyped
arrays), a `contains` always co-occurs with a known element type. Support
is therefore gated on that element type being **scalar**: the matcher runs
over values whose kind every target agrees on value-for-value (**P1**).

Grounding ([[PRINCIPLES.md]]): **P10** (enforced at the boundary), **P11**
(aggregated), **P12** (a pure predicate over the decoded value in the
**shared `Validate`** layer, identical both directions — no serialize-side
adapter logic of its own). No effect on emitted types. The scalar
restriction is the **P1** line: a scalar matcher is the same value/range
comparison [[enum]] / [[minimum]] / [[pattern]] already specify across all
four targets, whereas a portable composite deep-match is extra surface we
don't yet commit to.

Loader behavior:
- `contains` value not a valid subschema (`contains:5`, `contains:"x"`,
  `contains:[…]`) → reject (recurse).
- `contains` on a non-array [[type]] (`{type:"string", contains:…}`) →
  reject per **P7.1** (statically meaningless).
- `contains` present without `type:"array"` → reject per [[type]]
  (missing/mismatched type); a `type:"array"` still requires [[items]].
- **Shapeless matcher** — `contains:{}` / `contains:true` /
  `contains:false` → reject per **P7.1**. `{}` / `true` match every element
  (so `contains` degenerates to "non-empty" — the diagnostic points at
  `minItems:1`); `false` matches nothing (unsatisfiable at the default
  `minContains:1`). No element shape → no matcher.
- **Composite matcher** (`contains:{type:"object", …}` or
  `contains:{type:"array", …}`) → **reject** with a "not yet supported"
  diagnostic (deferred; see Support decision).
- **Composite element type** — `contains` paired with a composite [[items]]
  (`items:{type:"object", …}` / `items:{type:"array", …}`) → **reject**,
  deferred, exactly as [[uniqueItems]] defers composite elements.
- **Matcher type incompatible with the element type** — a scalar matcher
  whose [[type]] (or `const`/`enum` value kind) cannot match the [[items]]
  scalar element type (`items:{type:"string"}` + `contains:{type:"integer"}`,
  or `+ contains:{const:5}`) → reject as **statically unsatisfiable**
  (**P7.1**): no element can ever match. Parallel to [[enum]]'s member/type
  compatibility check. (A number matcher over an `integer` element, and
  vice-versa, follows [[type]]'s numeric rules — an integer-valued number
  normalizes, so `contains:{const:1.0}` over `items:{type:integer}` is
  fine.)
- **[[minContains]] / [[maxContains]]** present → validated by their own
  specs (non-negative integers, range satisfiability, the `minContains:0`
  relaxation). They require a sibling `contains` and cannot appear without
  one — see Interactions.

## Type mapping

None. The emitted collection type is [[items]]'s `[]T` / `T[]` /
`list[T]` / `List<T>`; the existential lives only in the validator.

## Validator mapping

Per **P10**/**P11**. A single **existence** scan. Deserialize scans the
original wire elements, including elements that fail [[items]] conversion;
serialize scans decoded elements. Each element is tested against the
scalar matcher predicate — the same shared predicate the matcher's own
keywords define ([[const]]/[[enum]] equality, [[minimum]]/[[maximum]]
range, [[pattern]] regex, [[minLength]]/[[maxLength]], [[multipleOf]]) —
and the scan **short-circuits on the first match** — *unless a
[[maxContains]] or a [[minContains]] ≥ 2 is present*: a plain `contains`
(or the equivalent `minContains:1`) needs only one hit, and no
[[unevaluatedItems]] annotation consumes the full index set, so there is
nothing to collect past the first. When a bound needs the exact tally (a
[[maxContains]], or [[minContains]] ≥ 2) the scan instead counts **all**
matches (see [[maxContains]]). If no element matches, one `Violation` is
pushed.

| Language | Strategy |
|---|---|
| Go | Deserialize scans the original `json.RawMessage` elements with the matcher's scalar parser and predicates; serialize scans the typed slice in shared `Validate`. A miss collects one violation into `ValidationError`. |
| TypeScript | After the `Array.isArray` guard ([[items]]), deserialize scans the raw array and serialize scans the typed array with the same scalar matcher predicates. A miss pushes one violation. |
| Python | The transfer converter calls `_check_contains` with the raw list on deserialize and the typed list on serialize. The matcher uses the same scalar predicates in either direction, including for typed-map members and [[oneOf]] branches. |
| Java | The per-POJO collecting deserializer scans the original `JsonNode` elements with the matcher type guard and predicates; serialize scans the typed `List<T>`. A miss pushes one violation into the single `ValidationException`. Not bean-validation. |

Reason strings name **what was required**, not a bare keyword — the matcher
is described by its own constraint (`no element equals "admin"` for a
`const` matcher, `no element matches minimum 5` for a range matcher,
`no element matches the required schema` as the general fallback), per the
informative-reason convention the constraint families use.

**Float exactness.** When the matcher is a `const`/`enum` over a `number`
element, equality is **exact `==`**, never an epsilon — identical to
[[enum]] / [[uniqueItems]]: the wire value and the matcher literal are both
IEEE-754 binary64 from correctly-rounded decimal→double parsing, so the
same decimal yields the identical bit pattern in every target. An
integer-valued number matcher such as `const:1.0` normalizes to an integer
at load (as in [[enum]]).

### Serialize-side (P12)

Identical to [[uniqueItems]]: the predicate **re-runs before emit** over the
decoded value, so an in-memory slice/list that holds no matching element
fails serialize with the same aggregated primitive rather than being
written. Real teeth in the statically-typed targets (Go/TS/Java), where
in-memory construction is unchecked. The elements are the same in memory as
on the wire, so the existence scan is the identical predicate in both
directions.

## Property-testing matrix

### Accepted (positive)

| Shape | Example |
|---|---|
| Contains a required value (`const` matcher) | `{type:"array", items:{type:string}, contains:{const:"admin"}}` |
| Contains a member of a set (`enum` matcher) | `{type:"array", items:{type:string}, contains:{enum:["admin","root"]}}` |
| Contains an element clearing a bound | `{type:"array", items:{type:integer}, contains:{type:integer, minimum:5}}` |
| Contains a pattern-matching element | `{type:"array", items:{type:string}, contains:{type:string, pattern:"^x"}}` |
| Integer-valued number matcher normalizes | `{type:"array", items:{type:integer}, contains:{const:1.0}}` |
| Match-count bounds ([[minContains]] / [[maxContains]]) | `{type:"array", items:{type:integer}, contains:{minimum:5}, minContains:2, maxContains:4}` |
| Combined with count/uniqueness assertions | `{type:"array", items:{type:string}, minItems:1, uniqueItems:true, contains:{const:"admin"}}` |
| Array member of a struct | `{type:"object", properties:{roles:{type:array, items:{type:string}, contains:{const:"admin"}}}}` |

### Rejected at load time (negative)

| Reason | Example |
|---|---|
| Matcher not a schema | `contains:5`, `contains:"x"`, `contains:[{type:string}]` |
| Type mismatch (P7.1) | `{type:"string", contains:{const:"a"}}` |
| Shapeless matcher (P7.1) | `{type:array, items:{type:string}, contains:{}}`, `…contains:true`, `…contains:false` |
| Composite matcher (deferred) | `{type:array, items:{type:object,…}, contains:{type:object,…}}` |
| Composite element type (deferred) | `{type:array, items:{type:object,…}, contains:{const:…}}` |
| Matcher type-incompatible with element (P7.1, unsatisfiable) | `{type:array, items:{type:string}, contains:{type:integer}}`, `…contains:{const:5}}` |

### Runtime fixtures (validator)

- At least one element matches → OK (both directions), regardless of how
  many.
- No element matches → one `ValidationError` naming the required matcher
  (`no element equals "admin"`).
- Empty array `[]` → **rejected** (nothing to match; the default is
  ≥ 1 match). Contrast [[minItems]] `0` / [[uniqueItems]], which pass
  vacuously on `[]`.
- Multiple matches → OK (existential; the scan short-circuits at the
  first).
- Combined with a failing sibling ([[minItems]] / [[maxItems]] /
  [[uniqueItems]] / a bad element per [[items]]) → **all** reported in one
  shot (**P11**).
- Serialize of an in-memory slice/list with no matching element → rejected
  before emit (**P12**), not silently written.

## Interactions

- **[[items]]**: gates the element type and thus applicability —
  `contains` is supported only when `items` is scalar; a composite `items`
  defers it. `items` types (and constrains) **every** element; `contains`
  asserts **some** element additionally satisfies the matcher. Orthogonal
  where both apply: an element must satisfy `items` to be present at all,
  and at least one must also satisfy `contains`.
- **[[minContains]] / [[maxContains]]**: the 2020-12 count-of-matches
  bounds that generalize `contains` from "≥ 1" to a range — **supported**
  (their own specs). They own the match-count machinery (a full tally
  rather than a short-circuit, since the count matters), require a sibling
  `contains`, and `minContains:0` relaxes the existential (vacuous alone,
  meaningful as a `0..maxContains` range). `contains` **alone** is exactly
  the spec-default ≥ 1.
- **[[minItems]] / [[maxItems]]**: array-level **element**-count
  assertions; `contains` is a **match**-count existential over a subset.
  All apply and aggregate. We do **not** collapse `contains` into an
  implied `minItems:1` (a matching array is necessarily non-empty, but the
  two reasons stay distinct) — parallel to the no-cross-check stance
  between [[uniqueItems]] and the count pair.
- **[[uniqueItems]]**: independent scalar-gated array assertions; both
  apply and aggregate. `uniqueItems` forbids repeats, `contains` requires a
  match — orthogonal.
- **[[const]] / [[enum]]**: the natural `contains` matchers — "the array
  contains value X" is `contains:{const:X}`, "…one of a set" is
  `contains:{enum:[…]}`. They share the **scalar value-equality**
  definition used here (exact `==` for numbers, normalized integer-valued
  numbers), and defer composite values identically.
- **[[minimum]] / [[maximum]] / [[pattern]] / [[minLength]] /
  [[maxLength]] / [[multipleOf]]**: any of these on the matcher subschema
  defines "match" for a `contains` over a numeric/string element; the scan
  reuses that keyword's own shared predicate.
- **[[type]]**: gates applicability to `type:"array"`; a mismatch is a load
  reject (**P7.1**). The emitted collection type is unchanged.
- **[[required]]**: orthogonal — `required` decides whether the array
  member is present; `contains` shapes its value. A present array must hold
  a match; an optional **absent** array raises no `contains` violation
  (nothing to scan — **P8**: optional ≠ the value constraint).
- **[[nullability]]**: if the element schema is the nullable
  [[nullability]] pattern, a `null` element matches `contains` only if the
  matcher itself is the null pattern (out of this scalar subset). Otherwise
  a `null` element simply never matches a scalar matcher — orthogonal.
- **[[prefixItems]] / [[unevaluatedItems]]**: the other array applicators,
  **rejected** per **P6**. With [[unevaluatedItems]] gone there is no
  consumer for `contains`' index annotation, which is why the scan
  short-circuits.
