# `minLength`

Source: JSON Schema 2020-12, Validation vocabulary, §6.3.2
"Validation Keywords for Strings → minLength".

Sets an **inclusive** lower bound on the **length of a string** instance,
counted in Unicode **code points** (RFC 8259). A pure runtime assertion —
no type impact. Mirror of [[maxLength]]; the shared string-length
machinery (code-point counting, the per-language primitive choice,
serialize-side re-check, exact-length pin) is documented once in
[[maxLength]] and referenced here.

## Spec summary

Verbatim (2020-12 validation, §6.3.2):

> The value of this keyword MUST be a non-negative integer.

> A string instance is valid against this keyword if its length is greater
> than, or exactly equal to, the value of this keyword.

> The length of a string instance is defined as the number of its
> characters as defined by RFC 8259.

> Omitting this keyword has the same behavior as a value of 0.

Distilled:
- Value MUST be a **non-negative integer**.
- Instance valid iff `codePointCount(instance) ≥ minLength`.
- Length = Unicode **code point** count, **no normalization** — exactly
  [[maxLength]]'s definition (see there for the NFC/NFD example).
- `minLength: 0` is a **no-op** (spec: same as omitting) — accepted but
  vacuous.
- Applies only to string instances; a `minLength` on a non-string [[type]]
  is rejected at load (**P7.1**).

## Support decision

**Support:** yes — runtime code-point-count comparison, [[maxLength]] with
`≥`. Same grounding: **P1** (identical code-point count across all four —
the crux, documented in [[maxLength]]), **P10** (enforced), **P11**
(aggregated), **P12** (shared `Validate` predicate, identical both
directions). No effect on emitted types.

Loader behavior (mirror of [[maxLength]] with `≥`):
- Value not a non-negative integer → reject: non-number, **negative**
  (`minLength:-1`), or **fractional** (`minLength:0.5`). `minLength:5.0`
  accepted (≡ `5`).
- `minLength` on a non-string [[type]] → reject (**P7.1**).
- **`minLength:0`** → accepted, treated as **omitted** (the spec's
  explicit equivalence); it constrains nothing. (Not rejected as
  "redundant" — it is a spec-sanctioned identity, and authors emit it from
  templated tooling; silently honoring it as a no-op is friendlier than a
  diagnostic.)
- **`minLength` > `maxLength` → reject (unsatisfiable)**; `minLength ==
  maxLength` pins an **exact** length (accepted). All combined-length
  satisfiability lives in [[maxLength]].
- A `const`/`default`/`enum` string literal on the **same node** shorter
  than `minLength` → reject at load (e.g. `{type:"string", minLength:5,
  const:"ab"}`) — the string-length half of the deferred
  literal-vs-constraint obligation (see [[maxLength]] / [[const]]).

## Type mapping

None. Constraint lives only in the validator.

## Validator mapping

Per **P10**/**P11**. A single `≥` comparison of the **code-point count**
against the fixed bound, identical in both directions (shared `Validate`,
**P12**). Same per-language strategy as [[maxLength]] with `< min` as the
failing comparison — how each language counts code points is the
load-bearing detail (`utf8.RuneCountInString` / Python `len` /
`codePointCount(0,length())`; TS the shared `codePointLength` scan with
early-exit, see [[maxLength]]), never the bare `len`/`.length`.

| Language | Strategy |
|---|---|
| Go | `if n := utf8.RuneCountInString(v); n < min { push(Violation{Reason: fmt.Sprintf("length must be >= %d, got %d", min, n)}) }` — a predicate in the shared `Validate`, which `UnmarshalJSON` calls after decoding, collecting into one `ValidationError`. |
| TypeScript | The shared `codePointLength` surrogate-aware scan (see [[maxLength]]) with **early-exit** the moment the running count reaches `min` (pass — no need to count the rest). If the string ends first the full count `n` is already in hand, so the failure path needs **no second pass** (the asymmetry with [[maxLength]], where the over-length case must recount): ``push(Violation{path, reason: `length must be >= ${min}, got ${n}`})``, throw one `ValidationError`. **Never `v.length`** (UTF-16 units). |
| Python | Pydantic `Annotated[str, Field(min_length=min)]` (`StringConstraints(min_length=min)`) — **verified to count code points** (see [[maxLength]] / `pydantic_length_probe.py`); aggregates in `pydantic.ValidationError`, whose message names the bound (`String should have at least 5 characters`). |
| Java | The per-POJO collecting deserializer (PRINCIPLES Java §5) reads the `String`, checks `int n = v.codePointCount(0, v.length()); if (n < min)`, pushing a `Violation{path, "length must be >= " + min + ", got " + n}` into the single `ValidationException`. Not bean-validation `@Size`. |

Reason strings name the concrete bound and offending count
(`length must be >= 5, got 2`), per the [[maximum]] convention.

### Serialize-side (P12)

Identical to [[maxLength]]: the predicate re-runs before emit over the
decoded value; an in-memory under-length string fails serialize rather
than being written. See [[maxLength]] serialize note (symmetric).

## Property-testing matrix

### Accepted (positive)

| Shape | Example |
|---|---|
| Inclusive min | `{type:"string", minLength:1}` (non-empty) |
| `.0`-valued bound | `{type:"string", minLength:1.0}` |
| Zero min (no-op) | `{type:"string", minLength:0}` |
| Exact length (min==max) | `{type:"string", minLength:5, maxLength:5}` |

### Rejected at load time (negative)

| Reason | Example |
|---|---|
| Value not a number | `minLength:"1"`, `minLength:false` |
| Negative value | `minLength:-1` |
| Fractional value | `minLength:0.5` |
| Type mismatch (P7.1) | `{type:"integer", minLength:1}` |
| Unsatisfiable range | `{type:"string", minLength:10, maxLength:2}` |
| Literal below bound | `{type:"string", minLength:5, const:"ab"}`, `{…, default:""}` |

### Runtime fixtures (validator)

- `codePointCount(v) == min` → OK (`≥` inclusive).
- `v` one code point under `min` → one `ValidationError` naming the bound
  and count (`length must be >= 5, got 4`).
- **Astral fixtures:** `"😀"` counts as **1** (satisfies `minLength:1`);
  the empty string `""` counts as **0**. Every language agrees (see
  [[maxLength]]).
- Combined with other failing assertions → all reported in one shot
  (**P11**). Serialize of an under-length in-memory value → rejected before
  emit (**P12**).

## Interactions

- **[[maxLength]]**: the paired upper bound; `minLength > maxLength` load
  error; `minLength == maxLength` pins an exact length (accepted). All
  combined-length satisfiability rules live in [[maxLength]].
- **[[pattern]]**: independent; both apply and aggregate. No
  regex-vs-length satisfiability cross-check (see [[maxLength]]).
- **[[type]]**: gates applicability; `minLength` never changes the emitted
  type — `string`, unless a materializing sibling ([[format]] /
  [[contentEncoding]]) governs it.
- **[[const]] / [[default]] / [[enum]]**: a supplied string literal MUST
  satisfy `minLength` at load (rule above). Closes the string-length
  portion of the deferred literal-vs-constraint obligation (see
  [[maxLength]]).
