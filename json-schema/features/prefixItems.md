# `prefixItems`

Source: JSON Schema 2020-12, Core (Applicator vocabulary), §10.3.1.1
"Keywords for Applying Subschemas to Arrays → prefixItems".

Validates array elements **positionally** — the *tuple* form. Element `i`
must validate against the `i`-th subschema. **Not supported** — rejected
at load time per **P6** (categorical exclusion, not a deferral).

## Spec summary

Verbatim (2020-12 core, Applicator):

> The value of "prefixItems" MUST be a non-empty array of valid JSON
> Schemas.

> Validation succeeds if each element of the instance validates against
> the schema at the same position, if any. This keyword does not constrain
> the length of the array. If the array is longer than this keyword's
> value, this keyword validates only the prefix of matching length.

> The annotation result of this keyword is the largest index to which
> this keyword applied a subschema, or the boolean true if applied to
> every index. This annotation affects the behavior of "items" and
> "unevaluatedItems".

Distilled:
- A per-position list of subschemas: element 0 → schema 0, element 1 →
  schema 1, etc. — a heterogeneous tuple.
- Elements past the prefix are governed by [[items]] (in our subset,
  `items` covers all elements, since `prefixItems` is rejected).
- The draft-7 array-valued spelling of `items` is this keyword renamed.

## Support decision

**Support:** no — **rejected at load time (P6).**

A positional tuple has no coherent lowering across the four targets:
- **P6 (strict subset)**: Go and Java have **no tuple type**; the only
  representations are a heterogeneous `[]any` / `Object[]` (forfeiting the
  typing the subset exists to provide) or a generated positional struct
  (a shape mismatch from the wire array). TS's `[A, B]` and Python's
  `tuple[A, B]` have no cross-language counterpart, so a shared, typed
  representation does not exist.
- **P7 / P7.1 (reject ambiguity loudly)**: a tuple wearing array clothes
  is exactly the kind of construct we reject at generator time rather than
  approximate.

Loader behavior:
- Any `prefixItems` present → reject with a located diagnostic.
- The array-valued (draft-7 tuple) spelling of `items` is the same
  construct and is likewise rejected — see [[items]].
- The diagnostic offers the two coherent alternatives:
  1. An **object with named [[properties]]** — when the positions are
     really distinct, meaningful fields.
  2. A **homogeneous list** — `{type:array, items:{type:T}}` — when the
     elements share a type (see [[items]]).

## Type mapping

None — rejected before any type is emitted.

## Validator mapping

None — rejected at load time, so there is no (de)serialize boundary and no
serialize-side behavior (**P12**).

## Property-testing matrix

### Rejected at load time (negative) — the whole surface

| Reason | Example |
|---|---|
| Tuple via `prefixItems` (P6) | `{type:array, prefixItems:[{type:string},{type:integer}]}` |
| `prefixItems` + `items` tail | `{type:array, prefixItems:[{type:string}], items:{type:integer}}` |
| Array-valued `items` (draft-7 tuple spelling) | `{type:array, items:[{type:string},{type:integer}]}` |

There are no accepted or runtime fixtures: the keyword never reaches code
generation.

## Interactions

- **[[items]]**: in 2020-12, `items` applies to elements *past* the
  `prefixItems` prefix. With `prefixItems` rejected, `items` applies to
  **all** elements — the homogeneous-list case is the supported form.
- **[[contains]]**: the array existential — supported for a scalar matcher
  (its own spec). **[[unevaluatedItems]]**: the other array applicator,
  also rejected per **P6**.
- **[[minItems]] / [[maxItems]] / [[uniqueItems]]**: array-level
  assertions over the element set; unaffected by this keyword's rejection.

## Ecosystem variance

| Source dialect | Action |
|---|---|
| JSON Schema 2020-12 | Reject (P6). |
| OpenAPI 3.1 | `prefixItems` present (3.1 adopts 2020-12) → reject. |
| OpenAPI 3.0 | No `prefixItems` keyword; single-schema `items` only — nothing to reject. |
| Swagger 2.0 / draft-4 | The array-valued `items` tuple form (and `additionalItems` tail) → reject; rewrite to an object or a homogeneous list. |
