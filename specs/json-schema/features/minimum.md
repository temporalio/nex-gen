# `minimum`

Source: JSON Schema 2020-12, Validation vocabulary, §6.2.4
"Validation Keywords for Numeric Instances → minimum".

Sets an **inclusive** lower bound on a numeric instance. A pure runtime
comparison assertion — no type impact. Mirror of [[maximum]]; the shared
numeric-bound machinery (per-language comparison, integer-vs-float
exactness, serialize-side re-check, combined-bound satisfiability) is
documented once in [[maximum]] and referenced here.

## Spec summary

Verbatim (2020-12 validation, §6.2.4):

> The value of "minimum" MUST be a number, representing an inclusive lower
> limit for a numeric instance.

> If the instance is a number, then this keyword validates only if the
> instance is greater than or exactly equal to "minimum".

Distilled:
- Value MUST be a JSON number.
- Instance valid iff `instance ≥ minimum`.
- Applies only to numeric instances; a `minimum` on a non-numeric [[type]]
  is rejected at load (**P7.1**).

## Support decision

**Support:** yes — runtime comparison assertion.

Same grounding as [[maximum]]: **P10** (enforced), **P11** (aggregated),
**P12** (shared `Validate` predicate, identical both directions). No effect
on emitted types.

Loader behavior (mirror of [[maximum]] with `≥`):
- Value not a number → reject.
- `minimum` on a non-numeric [[type]] → reject (**P7.1**).
- **On an `integer` field the bound MUST be integer-valued** — `minimum:0.0`
  accepted (≡ `0`), `minimum:0.5` rejected with a fix-it (same Pydantic
  build constraint as [[maximum]]).
- On a `number` field any finite bound is accepted.
- `minimum` below the [[type]] integer cap `−(2^53−1)` on an `integer`
  field is redundant (cap already rejects) but allowed.
- **`minimum` and `exclusiveMinimum` both present on the same node →
  reject (redundant)** — both are lower bounds, one always dominates; keep
  exactly one (**P7.1**, mirror of the [[maximum]] rule). The lower+upper
  mix `minimum` + `exclusiveMaximum` is *not* redundant (interval) and
  stays a satisfiability check. allOf tightening caveat: see [[maximum]] /
  [[allOf]].
- Combined-bound satisfiability and [[multipleOf]] emptiness are the
  [[maximum]] rules (see **Interactions → satisfiability** there):
  `minimum > maximum` → reject; `minimum ≥ exclusiveMaximum` → reject;
  integer interval with no integer → reject.

## Type mapping

None. Constraint lives only in the validator.

## Validator mapping

Per **P10**/**P11**. A single `≥` comparison against the fixed bound,
identical in both directions (shared `Validate`, **P12**). Same
per-language strategy as [[maximum]] with `< min` as the failing
comparison:

| Language | Strategy |
|---|---|
| Go | `if v < min { push(Violation{Reason: fmt.Sprintf("must be >= %v, got %v", min, v)}) }` — a predicate in the shared `Validate`, which `UnmarshalJSON` calls after decoding, collecting into one `ValidationError`. Integer field compares `int64`; number field compares `float64`. |
| TypeScript | ``if (v < min) push(Violation{path, reason: `must be >= ${min}, got ${v}`})``, throw one `ValidationError`. |
| Python | Pydantic `Ge(min)` (`annotated_types`), composing over the `SpecInt` `BeforeValidator` on integer fields (normalize `0.0`→`0`, then `Ge`) — verified in `pyd_numeric_probe.py`; aggregates in `pydantic.ValidationError`, whose message already names the bound (`Input should be greater than or equal to 0`). |
| Java | The per-POJO collecting deserializer (PRINCIPLES Java §5) reads the node via the [[type]] `SpecNumbers` helper and checks `v < min` (`long`/`double`), pushing a `Violation{path, "must be >= " + min + ", got " + v}` into the single `ValidationException`. Not bean-validation `@Min`. |

Reason strings name the concrete bound and offending value
(`must be >= 0, got -1`), per the [[maximum]] convention.
Integer-field-vs-float-bound comparison is lossless within the cap — see
[[maximum]] (the `(double)cap == cap` guarantee applies identically).

### Serialize-side (P12)

Identical to [[maximum]]: the predicate re-runs before emit over the
decoded value; an in-memory value below `minimum` fails serialize rather
than being written. See [[maximum]] serialize note (symmetric).

## Property-testing matrix

### Accepted (positive)

| Shape | Example |
|---|---|
| Integer inclusive min | `{type:"integer", minimum:0}` |
| Non-negative via `.0` | `{type:"integer", minimum:0.0}` |
| Number fractional min | `{type:"number", minimum:-1.5}` |
| Single-value range | `{type:"integer", minimum:5, maximum:5}` |

### Rejected at load time (negative)

| Reason | Example |
|---|---|
| Value not a number | `minimum:"0"`, `minimum:false` |
| Type mismatch (P7.1) | `{type:"string", minimum:0}` |
| Fractional bound on integer field | `{type:"integer", minimum:0.5}` |
| Redundant same-axis pair | `{type:"integer", minimum:0, exclusiveMinimum:2}`, `{type:"integer", minimum:0, exclusiveMinimum:0}` |
| Unsatisfiable range | `{type:"integer", minimum:10, maximum:2}` |

### Runtime fixtures (validator)

- `v == min` → OK (`≥` inclusive).
- `v == min-1` (integer) / just below `min` (number) → one
  `ValidationError` whose reason names the bound and value
  (`must be >= 0, got -1`).
- Combined with other failing assertions → all reported in one shot (P11).
- Serialize of an in-memory value below `min` → rejected before emit (P12).

## Interactions

- **[[maximum]]**: the paired upper bound; `min > max` load error;
  `min == max` pins a single value (accepted). All combined-bound
  satisfiability rules live in [[maximum]].
- **[[exclusiveMinimum]]**: same-axis (both lower) — `minimum` and
  `exclusiveMinimum` on one node is a **load reject** (one always
  dominates; keep exactly one).
- **[[multipleOf]]**: combines for satisfiability (no multiple in range →
  reject; see [[multipleOf]]).
- **[[type]]**: gates applicability; integer cap is the implicit floor
  `−(2^53−1)` on integer fields.
- **[[const]] / [[default]] / [[enum]]**: a supplied numeric literal MUST
  satisfy `minimum` at load — e.g. `{type:"integer", minimum:5, const:2}`
  and `{…, default:0}` are load rejects. Closes the numeric portion of the
  deferred literal-vs-constraint obligation (see [[maximum]]).

## Ecosystem variance

| Source dialect | Action |
|---|---|
| JSON Schema 2020-12 | Native. |
| OpenAPI 3.1 | Native. |
| OpenAPI 3.0 / draft-4 | `minimum` (inclusive) identical. Their `exclusiveMinimum` is a *boolean* modifier — rewrite handled in [[exclusiveMinimum]]. |
| Swagger 2.0 | Same as OAS 3.0. |
