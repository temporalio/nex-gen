# `items`

Source: JSON Schema 2020-12, Core (Applicator vocabulary),
§10.3.1.2 "Keywords for Applying Subschemas to Arrays → items".

Applies one subschema to every array element. The structural backbone of
every generated list type — the array analog of [[properties]]: it is
what turns `type:"array"` into a *typed* collection (`[]T` / `T[]` /
`list[T]` / `List<T>`) rather than an opaque one. The element type comes
from recursively mapping the `items` subschema.

## Spec summary

Verbatim (2020-12 core, Applicator):

> The value of "items" MUST be a valid JSON Schema.

> This keyword applies its subschema to all instance elements at indexes
> greater than the length of the "prefixItems" array in the same schema
> object, as reported by the annotation result of that "prefixItems"
> keyword. If no such annotation result exists, "items" applies its
> subschema to all instance array elements.

> The annotation result of this keyword is a boolean true if the
> subschema was applied to any positions of the instance array. This
> annotation affects the behavior of "unevaluatedItems".

> Omitting this keyword has the same assertion behavior as an empty
> schema.

Distilled:
- `items` constrains every element (in our subset there is no
  [[prefixItems]], so "every element" is literal — see Support).
- The value is a full subschema; the element type is that subschema's
  mapping, applied recursively.
- Omitting `items` = empty schema = **no constraint on elements** (spec
  default: an untyped array).
- 2020-12 note: the draft-7 array-of-schemas *tuple* spelling of `items`
  moved to [[prefixItems]]; in 2020-12 `items` is **always a single
  schema**. An array-valued `items` is a stale-draft artifact.

## Support decision

**Support:** yes — the homogeneous list case (`type:"array"` + a single
`items` subschema).

An array with `items` emits a typed collection whose element type is the
recursive mapping of the `items` subschema (itself rejected at load if it
is out of subset, per [[type]] and **P7.1**).

Rationale (citing [[PRINCIPLES.md]]):
- **P2 (idiomatic output)**: a homogeneous element schema lowers cleanly
  to the one collection type every target has (`[]T` / `T[]` /
  `list[T]` / `List<T>`).
- **P7 / P7.1 (strict schema)**: the element schema must carry an
  explicit, supported `type` (or the [[nullability]] `oneOf` pattern); a
  shapeless element (`{}` / `true` / `false`) leaves the element type
  undecidable and is rejected with a located diagnostic.

Loader behavior:
- `type:"array"` **without** `items` → **reject** per **P7.1**. Per spec
  this is a valid "array of anything", but the typed-codegen contract
  requires an explicit element type (the array parallel of `type:object`
  requiring a shape — see [[type]]). Diagnostic names the location and
  asks for `items:{...}`.
- `items` **without** `type:"array"` → reject per [[type]] (missing or
  mismatched `type`); require explicit `type:"array"`. The rule is not scoped
  to scalar types: a declared **`type:"object"`** carrying an `items` rejects
  too — an object's shape keywords ([[properties]],
  [[additionalProperties]]) do not license an array applicator beside them, and
  accepting one and dropping it is the silent passthrough **P7.1** forbids.
  It also holds however the `type` comes to be *absent*: a node carrying a
  [[oneOf]] or a [[ref]] declares no `type` of its own, so an `items` beside
  one is an authoring error and rejects rather than being dropped. An array
  *branch* carries its `items` inside the branch (see [[oneOf]]), and a sibling
  `items` folded onto a `$ref`'s merged node is subject to that node's own
  shape rules — a merged `type:"object"` rejects it like any other object.
- `items` value not a valid subschema → reject (recurse).
- `items` that is shapeless — `{}` / `true` / `false` → reject per
  **P7.1** (no element shape). Diagnostic names the array and asks for an
  explicit element `type`.
- `items` value that is an **array** (draft-7 tuple spelling) → reject;
  diagnostic notes 2020-12 moved tuples to [[prefixItems]], which is
  itself rejected per **P6** (below).
- [[prefixItems]] present (tuple form) → reject per **P6**. Heterogeneous
  positional tuples have no single coherent lowering — Go and Java have
  no tuple type, and a mixed `[]any`/`Object[]` would forfeit the typing
  the subset exists to provide. This is a categorical P6 exclusion, not a
  deferral; the diagnostic suggests an object with named [[properties]]
  instead.

## Type mapping

A `{type:"array", items:S}` schema emits the language-native ordered
collection over `T`, where `T` is the recursive mapping of the element
subschema `S`. Optional/nullable wrapping of the **array itself** is
owned by [[required]] + [[nullability]]; this table is the bare
collection type.

| Element `T` from `items` | Go | TypeScript | Python | Java |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| any supported `T` | `[]T` | `T[]` | `list[T]` | `List<T>` |

Notes:
- **Elements recurse.** `T` is produced by the same pipeline as any
  field type: a scalar (`items:{type:string}` → `[]string` / `string[]`
  / `list[str]` / `List<String>`), an object (`items` is a
  `{type:object, properties:{...}}` → a slice/array/list of the emitted
  aggregate), a nested array (`items:{type:array, items:{...}}` →
  `[][]T` / `T[][]` / `list[list[T]]` / `List<List<T>>`), or a `$ref`
  (see [[ref]]).
- **Element nullability is the element's own concern.** An element
  schema that is the recognized [[nullability]] `oneOf` pattern makes the
  *elements* nullable — `[]*T` (Go), `(T | null)[]` (TS),
  `list[T | None]` (Python), `List<@Nullable T>` (Java) — distinct
  from the array field itself being optional/nullable, which wraps the
  whole collection. The two axes compose (an optional array of nullable
  elements is legal), and neither implies the other: an optional array of
  nullable elements is `list[T | None] | None`, not `list[T | None]`.
- **An inline element shape is named.** An element schema that is an
  **object** or a `oneOf` *sum type* (two or more non-`null` branches) is
  named after its position at load — `<EnclosingType><Property>Item`,
  `…ItemItem` for a nested array — moved into `$defs`, and the element
  rewritten to a `$ref`, so the element type is an ordinary named model or
  union in every target (see [[properties]] §"Naming an inline object shape"
  and [[oneOf]] §"Unions in element positions"). This holds for **every**
  array position, not only a declared property: an array that is a [[oneOf]]
  branch or a typed-map member has its inline element shape named and hoisted
  the same way, at any depth. No element position falls back to an untyped map
  or a bare `Object`/`String` — if a name cannot be synthesized the load fails,
  rather than the element being emitted opaque and its declared members lost.
  Go and Java decode a *union*
  element through the union's dispatcher one value at a time — neither can
  allocate a sealed interface from a whole-collection decode.
- **Java** uses `List<T>` (interface type; the concrete `ArrayList` is an
  implementation detail of the deserializer). `List<T>` is a reference
  type, so it carries a non-null validator rather than boxing (see
  PRINCIPLES Java §3); element boxing follows `T`'s own [[type]] mapping.
- **Empty vs absent.** `[]` (present, empty) is distinct from an absent
  array (owned by [[required]]) and from `null` (owned by
  [[nullability]]); see the Go nil-slice substitution under Serialize-side.

## Validator mapping

Per **P10** the array type and every element are validated at the
(de)serializer boundary; per **P11** element failures aggregate.
`items` contributes the per-element dispatch; the outer array-type check
(`Array.isArray` / typed slice / `isinstance(v, list)` / typed `List`
binding) comes from [[type]]'s `"array"` row.

| Language | Strategy |
|---|---|
| Go | Custom `UnmarshalJSON` decodes the field into a shadow `[]*json.RawMessage`, then dispatches each element through `T`'s runtime helper, collecting `Violation{Path, Reason}` into the one `PayloadValidationError` application failure. `Path` threads the index: `tags[2]`. |
| TypeScript | Hand-emitted `Array.isArray` guard, then a per-element loop running `T`'s checks; push `Violation { path: "tags[2]", reason }` per bad element into the list, throw one `PayloadValidationError` application failure. |
| Python | The transfer type converter (PRINCIPLES Python §3) guards `isinstance(v, list)`, then loops the raw elements through `T`'s parse helper / converter, appending `Violation(path="tags[2]", reason=…)` per bad element and raising one generated `PayloadValidationError` application failure. The TypeScript parallel. |
| Java | the per-POJO collecting deserializer (PRINCIPLES Java §5) reads the array node, walks each element through `T`'s spec-strict/constraint helper, and collects `Violation{path:"tags[2]", reason}` into the one `PayloadValidationError` application failure. The Go parallel. |

- **Path convention.** Element failures use bracketed indices appended to
  the field path (`tags[2]`, and for nested arrays `matrix[1][2]`),
  distinct from the dotted member paths [[properties]] uses — so a caller
  can locate the offending element unambiguously (**P11**).
- **Reason convention.** An element takes the *same* checks — and so the
  same `reason` text — the value in that position would take anywhere
  else: a mistyped element reads `expected string` / `expected number`
  from [[type]]'s row for `T`, and a constraint failure reads that
  keyword's own reason (`must have length >= 3, got 1`). Nothing about the
  reason marks it as an element: the bracketed index in the path already
  does that, which leaves the reason free to name the type or bound that
  was missed. This holds for an element of a `oneOf` array branch exactly
  as for a declared array member (see [[oneOf]]). Reason *text* is not held
  byte-identical across targets (**P11**), but the shape is the same one
  everywhere.
- **Element recursion.** Each element validates recursively — an array of
  objects runs each object's own `Validate`, an array of arrays recurses
  again, an array of `$ref` follows the reference (see [[ref]]). A nested
  array decodes one loop per level, each level's loop variables carrying
  their depth so an inner element never shadows the level above it, and each
  level appending its own index to the path (`matrix[1][2]`).
- **Sibling array keywords inspect the original instance.** The parse adapter
  may build a partial typed collection while aggregating bad `items`, but
  [[minItems]], [[maxItems]], [[uniqueItems]], and [[contains]] evaluate the
  complete wire array. A failed element is neither removed nor replaced by a
  typed placeholder for those checks. Indexed element violations are emitted
  first, followed by array-level violations in keyword order. The rule applies
  recursively, including arrays in union branches and typed-map members.
- **Materializing elements use their ordinary adapters.** A temporal
  [[format]] or [[contentEncoding]] in `items` is parsed and serialized through
  the same generator-owned adapter as a declared property, at every nesting
  depth. Required runtime support is discovered recursively from the element
  schema, rather than only from top-level properties.
- **The wrapper does not change what the elements require.** Wrapping the
  array in the [[nullability]] wrapper leaves the element schema's demands on
  the emitter untouched: every package-level compiled-regex static the elements
  or a [[contains]] matcher need — [[pattern]], [[format]],
  [[contentEncoding]] — is still emitted for a **nullable** array, at the same
  position the code referencing it uses, or the package refers to an undeclared
  identifier. And a nullable array is still `[]T`, including as a typed
  [[additionalProperties]] value, so the element traversal ranges over the
  value and never over `*value`. The same holds however the array is reached —
  a declared property, a typed-map member, a [[oneOf]] branch, or a deeper
  element.
- **Empty array.** The element loop is vacuous; an empty `[]` passes the
  `items` check (array-length floors, when supported, live in their own
  specs — see Interactions).

### Serialize-side (P12)

`items` is symmetric across directions: serialize recurses the shared
`Validate` into each element (a nested aggregate element runs its own
`MarshalJSON`/`toTransferType`/`to_transfer_type`; a scalar element re-runs the
same predicate the deserializer used) **before emitting a byte**, failing
with the same aggregated primitive (**P11**), and re-emits elements in
order (arrays are ordered — unlike object members, element order is part
of the value and is preserved).

This includes arrays that are branches of a [[oneOf]]: branch selection does
not bypass the ordinary recursive array parser/mapper, so **element
conversion**, constraints, materialization, nested models, and indexed
aggregation remain identical to a declared array property. A branch whose
elements are models is converted element by element, never handed to the
encoder as the in-memory collection.

- **Go nil-slice substitution.** A `nil` `[]T` marshals to JSON `null` under
  `encoding/json`, not `[]`. For a **required, non-nullable** array that is the
  wrong wire form, so the generated `MarshalJSON` writes `[]` — Go has no
  non-nil empty-slice type, and the substitution is the deliberate, implemented
  design for that one target (see the [[nullability]] serialize table). It
  preserves the absent-vs-zero distinction **P9** forces everywhere. What is
  **Go-only** is this **empty-vs-`null` aliasing**, not the wider question: the
  other three targets can each hold an empty reference on a required
  non-nullable array (Java `null`, Python `None`, TypeScript
  `undefined`/`null`), and there the serialize side must **reject** rather than
  write an emptiness the schema forbids. *(Status: unimplemented — Java omits
  the key, TypeScript and Python assign the empty reference straight through;
  none of the three raises the violation this clause requires.)* The decision itself is owned by
  [[required]] + [[nullability]], recorded here because the array type is where
  it bites.

## Property-testing matrix

### Accepted (positive)

| Shape | Example |
|---|---|
| List of scalars | `{type:array, items:{type:string}}` |
| List of objects (element named after the position) | `{type:array, items:{type:object, properties:{id:{type:integer}}}}` |
| Nested array | `{type:array, items:{type:array, items:{type:integer}}}` |
| Element with assertions | `{type:array, items:{type:string, minLength:1}}` |
| Nullable elements | `{type:array, items:{oneOf:[{type:string},{type:null}]}}` |
| Union elements (named after the position) | `{type:array, items:{oneOf:[{type:string},{type:integer}]}}` |
| Array member of a struct | `{type:object, properties:{tags:{type:array, items:{type:string}}}}` |
| Self-reference via `items`, **required** OK (see [[ref]]) | tree node — the empty array terminates the recursion: `{type:object, properties:{value:{type:string}, children:{type:array, items:{$ref:"#"}}}}` with `children` required |

### Rejected at load time (negative)

| Reason | Example |
|---|---|
| `type:array` without `items` (P7.1) | `{type:array}` |
| `items` without `type:array` (per [[type]]) | `{items:{type:string}}` (no `type`) |
| Shapeless element (P7.1) | `{type:array, items:{}}`, `…items:true`, `…items:false` |
| Element not a schema | `{type:array, items:"string"}`, `…items:5` |
| Out-of-subset element (P7.1, recurse) | `{type:array, items:{type:object}}` (object with no shape) |
| Array-valued `items` (draft-7 tuple) | `{type:array, items:[{type:string},{type:integer}]}` |
| Tuple via `prefixItems` (P6) | `{type:array, prefixItems:[{type:string},{type:integer}]}` |
| `items` paired with non-array `type` | `{type:string, items:{type:string}}`, `{type:object, properties:{…}, items:{type:string}}` |
| `items` beside a `oneOf` or a `$ref` (no `type` of its own) | `{oneOf:[{type:string},{type:integer}], items:{type:string}}` |

### Runtime fixtures (validator)

- Element valid / invalid against the element schema; a bad element
  reports at its index path (`tags[2]`).
- Multiple bad elements → all reported in one shot (**P11**).
- Empty array `[]` → accepted (element check vacuous).
- Non-array instance (`{}`, `"x"`, `5`) → rejected by the [[type]]
  `"array"` check, not by `items`.
- Nested array element failure → nested index path (`matrix[1][2]`).
- Array of objects → each element runs its aggregate's own `Validate`;
  failures thread the index into the member path (`items[0].id`).
- Self-reference via `items` (see [[ref]]): a recursive instance of
  bounded depth validates and round-trips; the empty array terminates the
  chain, so a required `items:{$ref:"#"}` field is satisfiable (contrast
  the direct self-reference rule in [[properties]] / [[ref]]).
- Round-trip preserves element **order** and empty-vs-populated shape
  (Go required-array `nil` → `[]`, per Serialize-side).

## Interactions

- **[[type]]**: `items` is only meaningful under `type:"array"`; pairing
  with any other `type` is a generator-time error, and `type:"array"`
  **requires** `items` (no untyped arrays — the array parallel of the
  object-shape requirement in [[type]]).
- **[[prefixItems]]**: the 2020-12 positional-tuple keyword — **rejected**
  per **P6** (no coherent cross-language tuple lowering). With it rejected,
  `items` applies to *all* elements, so the annotation-dependent "elements
  past the prefix" clause never engages in our subset.
- **[[contains]]**: the array **existential** — supported for a scalar
  matcher over a scalar `items` element type (its own spec); layers over the
  same element set `items` types. **[[unevaluatedItems]]**: **rejected** per
  **P6** (annotation-dependent semantics don't lower).
- **[[minItems]] / [[maxItems]]**: array-level count assertions that layer
  over the same element set (see their specs); both count the full array
  including every `items`-validated element, and are orthogonal to the
  element typing `items` supplies. **[[uniqueItems]]**: element-uniqueness
  assertion over the same element set (its own spec).
- **[[nullability]]**: owns optional/nullable wrapping of the array field;
  element-level nullability is expressed by the element subschema (the
  `oneOf` null pattern) and composes with the field wrapping. The
  empty-vs-`null` decision on a required non-nullable array — Go's `[]`
  substitution and the other three targets' reject (Serialize-side) — is made
  there. Wrapping the array does not change what its elements require of the
  emitter (Validator mapping).
- **[[required]]**: orthogonal — decides whether the array member must be
  present; `items` types its elements. A present-but-empty `[]` satisfies
  `required` (presence, not non-emptiness — non-emptiness is
  [[minItems]]).
- **[[ref]]**: `items` may be a `$ref`, including one resolving back to the
  containing type. A self-reference wrapped in an array **terminates** (the
  empty array ends the chain), so — unlike a direct object self-reference —
  it may be **required and non-nullable** (see [[properties]] / [[ref]]).

## Ecosystem variance

| Source dialect | Action |
|---|---|
| JSON Schema 2020-12 | Native (`items` = single schema over all elements). |
| OpenAPI 3.1 | Aligns with 2020-12. Native. |
| OpenAPI 3.0 | `items` is single-schema-only (no tuple form) — matches our list case. Native; `nullable:true` on the element → reject (rewrite to the nullability `oneOf`). |
| Swagger 2.0 / draft-4 | Single-schema `items` maps natively; the **array** `items` tuple form (and its `additionalItems` tail) → reject, rewrite to a homogeneous list or an object with named [[properties]]. |
