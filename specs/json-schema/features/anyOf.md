# `anyOf`

Source: JSON Schema 2020-12, Core (Applicator vocabulary), §10.2.1.2
"Keywords for Applying Subschemas With Boolean Logic → anyOf".

The **inclusive-or** boolean-logic applicator: an instance is valid iff it
validates against **at least one** branch — and, unlike [[oneOf]], any
number of branches may match at once. **Not supported** — rejected at load
time per **P6** (categorical exclusion, not a deferral). It is the sibling
[[oneOf]] earns its place *against*: "exactly one" is a closed sum type with
a decidable selector, whereas "at least one" is an overlapping,
non-discriminated choice with no coherent typed lowering.

## Spec summary

Verbatim (2020-12 core, Applicator, §10.2.1.2):

> This keyword's value MUST be a non-empty array. Each item of the array
> MUST be a valid JSON Schema.

> An instance validates successfully against this keyword if it validates
> successfully against at least one schema defined by this keyword's value.

> Note that when annotations are being collected, all successful
> validations against subschemas MUST continue and their annotations
> collected.

Distilled:
- The value is a non-empty array of subschemas — the **branches**. The
  instance is valid iff **at least one** branch validates; **two or more**
  matching is explicitly fine (and, per the annotation note, *all* matching
  branches contribute — there is no single "the" branch).
- This is inclusive-or, not the exclusive-or of [[oneOf]] and not the
  intersection of [[allOf]]. The branches are free to **overlap**: a value
  may satisfy several at once, so there is no well-defined "which one" to
  bind to.
- Validity is defined by brute-force validation against the branches; the
  keyword says nothing about telling them apart, and — because overlap is
  permitted — nothing *can* be relied on to tell them apart.

## Support decision

**Support:** no — **rejected at load time (P6).**

`anyOf` has no coherent typed lowering in the strict subset:

- **P6 (strict subset), no decidable selector.** A faithful *typed*
  lowering of a choice needs to bind a wire value to **one** in-memory
  representation. [[oneOf]] can do this because "exactly one" guarantees the
  branches are disjoint and the generator further requires a decidable
  selector (a JSON type token, or a shared required-`const` tag) so a
  deserializer routes each value to a single branch without guessing.
  `anyOf` gives up both halves: branches **may overlap**, so even a
  brute-force "first branch that validates" is order-dependent and
  arbitrary, and there is no closed, disjoint selector to key on. There is
  no static type across the four targets for "a value that matches one *or
  more* of these possibly-overlapping shapes" — the only lowerings are to
  forfeit typing (a bare `any`/`interface{}`/`Object`) or to synthesize a
  union that silently changes meaning (turning inclusive-or into the
  exclusive-or of [[oneOf]], which does not round-trip identically, **P1**).
- **P7 / P7.1 (reject ambiguity loudly).** A choice whose branches can be
  simultaneously satisfied is exactly the ambiguity we refuse to guess at:
  binding it would require trial-validating every branch and then picking
  one by an invented rule (declaration order, "most fields matched"), which
  is silently-incorrect output. We reject at generator time instead.

Loader behavior:
- Any `anyOf` present → reject with a located diagnostic. This holds on a raw
  [[allOf]] branch, and on the implicit conjunct of a `$ref`-with-siblings: the
  location carries the branch index and the diagnostic is this one, never a
  merge conflict over the keyword's value.
- The diagnostic offers the coherent alternatives:
  1. **[[oneOf]]** — when the branches are genuinely a *closed, exclusive*
     choice: make them disjoint (distinct JSON kinds, or a shared required
     **`const`-tag** across object branches) and the choice is a supported
     sum type.
  2. **[[allOf]]** — when the intent was "must satisfy all of these" (the
     branches were being *combined*, not chosen between); `allOf` merges
     them into one schema at load ([[allOf]]).
  3. A single widened branch — when the branches differ only in a
     constraint that is really optional, drop to the common supertype and
     express the variation with ordinary optional members.

## Type mapping

None — rejected before any type is emitted.

## Validator mapping

None — rejected at load time, so there is no (de)serialize boundary and no
serialize-side behavior (**P12**).

## Property-testing matrix

### Rejected at load time (negative) — the whole surface

| Reason | Example |
|---|---|
| Inclusive-or, no decidable selector (P6) | `{anyOf:[{type:string},{type:integer}]}` (use [[oneOf]] — disjoint kinds) |
| Overlapping object branches (P6/P7.1) | `{anyOf:[{type:object,properties:{a:{…}}},{type:object,properties:{b:{…}}}]}` (both match `{}`) |
| Constraint-only union that was really a combine (P6) | `{anyOf:[{type:string,minLength:3},{type:string,maxLength:10}]}` (use [[allOf]] to intersect, or a single branch) |
| Single-branch wrapper (P7.1) | `{anyOf:[{type:string}]}` (use the branch directly) |
| Empty array (invalid schema) | `{anyOf:[]}` |

There are no accepted or runtime fixtures: the keyword never reaches code
generation.

## Interactions

- **[[oneOf]]**: the supported neighbor. `oneOf` is admitted because
  "exactly one" is a closed sum type *and* the generator requires a
  decidable selector; `anyOf` relaxes "exactly one" to "at least one" and
  permits overlap, removing exactly the disjointness/selector that makes the
  lowering coherent. Converting a genuinely exclusive `anyOf` to a
  discriminated [[oneOf]] is the primary fix.
- **[[allOf]]**: the intersection applicator. When branches were meant to be
  *combined* rather than chosen between, `allOf` is the coherent keyword —
  it merges/flattens to one schema at load.
- **[[nullability]]**: nullability is expressed with the two-branch
  `oneOf:[{T},{null}]` pattern, never `anyOf`.
- **[[dependentSchemas]]** / [[not]] / `if`/`then`/`else`: the other
  boolean-logic / conditional applicators rejected per **P6**; see
  [[if-then-else]] for the conditional-shape rationale.

## Ecosystem variance

| Source dialect | Action |
|---|---|
| JSON Schema 2020-12 | Reject (P6). |
| OpenAPI 3.1 | `anyOf` present (3.1 adopts 2020-12) → reject; the fix-it points at a discriminated [[oneOf]]. |
| OpenAPI 3.0 | `anyOf` exists with the same inclusive-or semantics → reject. |
| Swagger 2.0 | No `anyOf` keyword — nothing to reject. |
| draft-4..7 | `anyOf` present since draft-4 with identical semantics → reject. |
